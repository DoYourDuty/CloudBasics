### The SaaS Service Model
SaaS refers to Software as a Service, and this is generally considered to be one of the original cloud service models. There were a lot of companies that were providing centralized access to a particular type of application and users would simply subscribe to that as opposed to purchasing, and licensing, and distributing, and maintaining that software internally. Now typically web-based applications that don't require any special type of client are among the more common applications, but they're certainly not the only ones. But when you are using a web-based application, the only thing you need is a browser. So they're very good candidates for Software as a Service applications. Customers will typically access the same application through different partitions or what's also referred to as views of the application. The example here is that it might be something like a database-based application, maybe a Customer Management Application or an Enterprise Resource Planning. We are both using the same application as two different customers, but my data is separate from your data. So I only see my information, you only see your information, and we don't have access to each other's in any way, shape, or form, but it's still the same application being delivered from the same provider.

So the nice feature here is that the service provider is responsible for virtually everything except for your own client systems. In other words, they have to purchase it, they have to license it, they have to manage it, and maintain it, and upgrade it. All of that stuff falls to the provider instead of you as the customer, which again is a very nice feature. Now as far as the characteristics go, there are benefits and limitations, but sometimes it's a matter of perspective. So the very first one here, limited customization. Now that might seem like a limitation, but in some cases, it is exactly what you want. We don't want the users to be able to make changes and customize the application. So, you know, again it's a matter of perspective. Sometimes limitations are desirable. So typically, it is something that you will find with an SaaS model. Centralized support and maintenance by the service provider, and again that's in almost every case a benefit. You don't have to worry about that application. Analytics and usage stats and trends are typically available via the provider, so you can find out who is using it, when they're using it, for how long, how much data are they accessing things, like that, all kind of statistics and usage reports can be delivered from the provider because they track it.

Integration limitations that certainly might be a limitation as the name suggests, it might be difficult to integrate it into your environment with respect to maybe other applications that you use. Disparate locations, there are some latency concerns because you are accessing this application over the Internet, it could be a little bit of a delay, the time it takes to access the information might be a little bit too slow. Multi-tenancy refers to the fact that there are multiple customers of the same application. So again, there's little to no customization and there could be security issues. Shared access to data between customers if any kind of a flaw is discovered in the application. So in other words, it is possible that somebody may be able to access your data. Now most providers are very aware of this and will do everything within their means to ensure that it does not happen. But you need to ensure that the provider is doing everything that they can.

Security, more so, from the perspective of the internal organization of the provider, so the employees of the service provider have full access to the systems that are housing the data. So obviously, you need to be assured that they are treating that data appropriately. A couple of examples, Outlook.com for e-mail, Google Drive for storage, Salesforce.com. These are all just examples of various Software as a Service applications and anyone can access these services via a subscription and simply start using them right away without having to deploy really anything to their own internal environments other than, of course, having a device for your users. But basically, that is the Software as a Service model.

### The PaaS Service Model
The PaaS service model refers to Platform as a Service. And with this, the customers are provided with a platform to use for their computing requirements. Now that's a fairly broad scope statement to say, here's a platform. What kind of platform? What is this? What is it for? Well, there are a lot of variants there and it could be something fairly simple. But usually, what it refers to is a development environment, something that you can use for your developers to build things like web-based applications and any other kind of software. So it provides your developers with operating systems, all of the necessary server infrastructure to host things like web sites, and the actual development software itself, and all of the libraries that go along with it. That's typically what people mean when they say a platform. Now it doesn't have to be that robust. It could be something as simple as you want to view virtual machines just to test some network configurations or various other features. That still counts as a platform. But it does generally refer more so to this development environment.

So again like any cloud model, rather than having to purchase all of the equipment and all of the necessary software to build this internally, simply subscribe to the cloud service provider's already existing platform, and they will have everything for you. So as far as some of the characteristics go, you do have full control of application customization because you are developing your own applications. So obviously, they are going to do whatever you want them to do, but there may be limited or even no customization to the platform itself. So what that means is, let's imagine that you to build some web-based applications. Obviously, the web-based application you're constructing is up to you. But it needs to run on a server that has web server software installed. So the platform may not give you a lot of options. Your provider, whoever it might be, for example, might only offer a Windows Server 2012 system running IIS. So if that's the case, you don't have any customization of the platform. This depends, of course, on the provider, and most of them do give you some variance in the choice but it might be limited.

The customer has full visibility to all application usage and trends. Usually, there is an ability to view the platform usage analytics as well. All of the services that are offered by providers are typically metered, so that you can see who is using what and what kind of activity is happening within any given development environment. So you could track, if you will, what's going on. Integration, data is stored at the provider site, but the customer does have direct access to any data it requires. So again, it's just a matter of the physical location. And as far as the responsibilities go, the provider is responsible for everything at the development platform level and below. So things like the operating system, patches, and updates, and even the development software itself falls to the responsibility of the service provider. Of course, they maintain the hardware. They have to upgrade and things like that. That all falls to them. But from the customer perspective, you are responsible for everything above the operating system and deployment platform level, such as, of course, the applications you are developing. Installation and maintenance of any additional applications and the actual data itself, that is your responsibility as the customer.

Now some of the challenges you may face, again flexibility, there may be limited offerings of the specific platform SaaS, so that's kind of comes back to what we mentioned earlier. There may not be a lot of variance in terms of which servers and which software platforms they provide. And the security can be a challenge because the provider does still have direct access to all of the applications that you're building and the data itself. So, you know, again you need to determine whether or not that is acceptable. Some of the Platform as a Service, examples, Windows Azure absolutely provides this and they're current, as of the time of this recording, their current offering is what's known as Visual Studio Online in terms of the development environment. So they not only give you the virtual machines and things like web servers. They also actually give you the development environment itself. So Visual Studio is what you might use internally if you had your own development environment. When you do it through Windows Azure, it's Visual Studio Online. So you don't have to purchase and/or license a copy of Visual Studio. Google App Engine is another example of PaaS and again it's like anything. You just have to research some of these providers, and find out what offerings they have, and determine whether or not that will suit your needs. But in most cases, Platform as a Service provides you with this development environment to construct applications and/or web-based sites and applications. So if you can make use of this through PaaS service models, then all the better. And hopefully, they will suit the needs of your organization.

### The IaaS Service Model
The IaaS service model and its characteristics refers to Infrastructure as a Service. And as the name suggests, this is effectively your foundation. This provides the core services, such as computing power, storage, networking, and operating systems, so things like just being able to store data, building of virtual machine to use as one of your regular servers, and being able to, of course, access that server through standard networking, so you know, the very basics of an IT environment. So as a customer, you build your own environment on top of these resources, just like you might do in an on-premise environment. You start with the foundation and you build up from there.

Now as far as the responsibilities go, the provider is responsible for what's known as the hypervisor layer if you use it and below the hypervisor refers to virtualization. So when you create a virtual machine on a physical computer, it is the hypervisor that acts as an intermediary between the virtual machine and possibly several virtual machines, and the actual hardware itself because you have competition if you will. If you have, let's say, five or six virtual machines, all running on one physical server, then the hypervisor is responsible for controlling access to the real hardware and sharing the resources amongst the virtual machines. So that's the hypervisor layer and everything down from that. As a customer, you don't actually see the hypervisor layer. You just build your virtual machines. You don't even really know what physical server that they might reside on or even what the hypervisor is. So again, that is the provider's responsibility. They are entirely responsible for the physical hardware as well, including things like storage and networking.

As the customer, you are responsible for most of the environment, excluding, of course, what was just mentioned in the provider responsibilities. But if you start with a virtual machine, you install effectively operating system and the applications. Now once you choose an operating system image, it is up to you from that point to make sure that remains current and to make sure that it remains secure. Things like antivirus, threat protection applications, any kind of security software, basically, is up to you. The provider will keep the hardware current, but you are the one responsible for making sure that the virtual machines and all their software from that point on are kept up to date. As far as the costs go, there are some challenges here. You are charged for resource usage. So things like the amount of processing that's required and the amount of memory that you've used, it needs to be monitored, so that you will know what to expect when you get your bill. Customers that don't carefully monitor this usage may incur fairly high charges. So it's something you do want to keep an eye on. A couple of examples of IaaS, Amazon EC2 Service and Rackspace. Now there are other examples, of course. It really depends on what your provider offers and what you are doing with your cloud services. But Infrastructure as a Service, again, is effectively that foundation upon which you build everything else.

### Other Cloud Computing Service Models
There are some other cloud computing service models available depending on your needs and they include things like Database as a Service, or DBaaS, which provides a database platform that any organization can use to simply store their data in some kind of database structure. And the idea behind this is, again, that you do not need to purchase a physical server or even create a new virtual machine. You do not need to purchase and license the database software itself nor do you need to maintain any of it. You simply get a database that you can construct in the cloud to store your data. Desktop as a Service, or DaaS, provides users with a virtual desktop to perform desktop computing. And you might see this in a scenario, wherein your organization has just done an upgrade to the most recent operating system, but now an older application that you were using is no longer supported. So you might need the older operating system still available. So you might choose to do this within a new virtual desktop environment, so that you can still support that legacy application.

Storage as a Service, or STaaS, becoming very common, a lot of providers offer this and a good example of this is if you just need to store a copy of a backup offsite, you know, to prevent or protect from something like a natural disaster and your entire physical location going down. So that's a good example of Storage as a Service. Communication as a Service, or CaaS, might include things like a voice over IP system. Business Process as a Service, or BPaaS, just, you know, any kind of business process, enterprise resource planning, customer management, things like that. Security as a Service, Integration as a Service, and Testing as a Service, these are all these additional types of cloud computing service models that are available. And you just need to find out if these are the things that you need. You just have to do a little bit of research into the provider to see if they offer these types of services. And, of course, you know, what kind of cost is associated with them and configuration and controller responsibilities just like any other cloud computing service model. But it's not just all about virtual machines, and development, and things like that, they have a lot of these offshoots, if you will, in terms of their service models. So hopefully, you can find one that suits the needs of your organization.

### Development of Cloud Computing
So how did cloud computing come to be what it is today? Well, it is a collection of what's referred to as primary influences plus enabling technologies that has resulted in our modern cloud environment. So what are primary influences and what are the enabling technologies? Well, we'll take a look at both. But the influences include things like clustering, grid computing, and virtualization. Now these are technologies that were developed to enhance overall computing, but not necessarily developed with cloud computing in mind. They just happened to become the core requirements for cloud computing. So looking at clustering for starters, this is a group of independent IT resources that are interconnected and work as a single system, so hence the term a cluster. It is a collection of systems. This is designed to reduce the system failure rates and more importantly increase the availability and reliability of a particular server or service. And the key behind it is redundancy and failover features that are inherent to the cluster that has ended up being core to cloud platforms because we need those systems to remain available.

So in a very simple example, imagine a web server. That single web server has, let's say, a 100 web sites on it. Well, you have a single point of failure in the server itself. If that server goes down, you will lose all 100 sites. So the idea is to implement at least one more server into a cluster configuration and that secondary server acts as a standby, so that if the primary server does fail, every site is redundantly copied onto the other server. And it can assume the workload of the primary, in the event that it fails. And in most cases, clients will not notice any interruption of service. At the worst, you might have to refresh the page or something like that. But basically, one server goes down, there is another one available and you can have very large clusters where many systems are all servicing the request at the same time. It depends, but the core idea is that you lose one system, you don't have that single point of failure. There are others that can continue to service the workload.

Grid computing is similar in that there are still multiple computers. So it provides a platform in which computing resources are organized into one or more logical pools. So the pool still involves multiple systems. And those pools are collectively coordinated to provide a high performance distributed grid. So as I mentioned, it's similar to clustering in that we have multiple systems. But those grid systems are much more loosely coupled and distributed versus clustering. So again coming back to my web server example, as simple example, there was just one primary, one secondary. Those two systems are very tightly coupled. The primary goes down, the secondary assumes the workload. And it's the exact same workload, so that's tightly coupled. In a grid system, it's much more loose. There might be one particular processing job that is simply being distributed across multiple systems at the same time. They're all working on the same job and that division of labor, if you will, might vary all the time. One system might be particularly busy, while another system is not doing a whole lot. So that less busy system might assume more of the workloads. That's very loosely coupled.

It can involve resources that are geographically dispersed. They do not need to be, you know, on the same server room or even in the same office. And influential features included network access, resource pooling, scalability, and resiliency. So again, this is just simply to take a given workload and distribute it across multiple systems, so that they can all work on it together. Virtualization is a technology platform used for the creation of virtual instances of IT resources and this allows physical IT resources to provide multiple virtual images of themselves. So that underlying processing capabilities can be shared by multiple users. This overcomes the traditional challenge of performance, reliability, and scalability limitations. Now the most common example of virtualization is what's known as the virtual machine. One physical computer that has multiple installations of various operating systems on that particular system, each one represented as a virtual machine. So this allows you to make much better use of the resources of that server because installing just a single operating system and running a few applications might barely scratch the surface of what it's actually capable of in terms of its hardware. So by hosting multiple virtual machines on that single physical server, you get much better utilization.

Now finally, the enabling technologies, in essence, where how we could pull all these influences together to enable the creation of cloud computing. So things like broadband networks and the Internet architecture absolutely enabled us to use cloud computing. You go back 20 years or so years, you know, broadband networks were just barely coming into existence and their speeds were nowhere near fast enough to support cloud technology. So these days, we absolutely have that architecture in place. Data center technology, you know, very large environments with just huge amounts of resources, so that we can make these services available to a number of customers. Modern virtualization technology, there's more than just virtual machines out there, there's virtual networks, there's virtual storage, all kinds of virtualization methods. Web technology, certainly the ability to support various types of applications these days on the web. Multi-tenant technology, the ability to have multiple customers using the same service. And simply the service technology that's available these days. So the combination of all of these plus those original influences have, in essence, resulted in the cloud computing models that we see today.

### Benefits of  Cloud Computing
Cloud computing can provide a number of benefits to an organization including some business benefits, operational benefits, and strategic benefits. And we'll take a look at all three categories here. So starting with the business benefits, one of the first ones is simply the increased agility and flexibility that you gain with cloud computing. Any kind of new application, for example, that you might want to implement is readily available. You don't have to purchase it, you don't have to license it, you don't have to distribute it, manage it, update it. All of that stuff just really goes away. It's up to the provider to handle all the infrastructure, the maintenance, the upgrades, the patches, all of that. You just simply select the application or the service that you require and it's made available and in some cases, literally within minutes. So you have a very, very flexible environment. Improved asset utilization, the corporate assets that you do have with particular respect to your IT infrastructure may not even be necessary anymore depending on the degree to which you go with about services. But you can make much better use of that which you do have. The cloud type of solution presents you with all the necessary infrastructure. So you probably can remove a lot of those capital expenses.

The pay-as-you-go cost structure, so that you don't have any kind of unused equipment or services that are hanging around that you've already paid for. With this model, you simply pay for what you use. So utilization in terms of your expenses and expenditures are much better managed as well. And certainly the reduced overhead, as mentioned, you may not even require some of those servers and network equipment. So the overall IT infrastructure purchases that you might have had to make earlier or previously, just don't exist when you go with the cloud type of scenario. Also, low environmental impact, because you don't need all of this physical equipment, you have less power; you have less cooling that's required. You basically don't have nearly as much equipment to handle. So you have a better environmental impact as well.

As for operational benefits, we definitely have lower operational costs because of the pay-as-you-go model, you don't end up paying for things that you don't use and that certainly could be the case if you were to purchase all of that in-house. You might have acquired a very large amount of equipment, or software, or various services that are configured or even, of course, personnel required to support and maintain that, then you may not end up using it all that much. So again, the pay-as-you-go model definitely can help lower the operational costs. Greatly simplified maintenance because again the provider is responsible for everything that they provide for you. The equipment, the software, the upgrades, the maintenance, all of that falls to the provider. So a greatly simplified maintenance structure. And the quality of service and reliability is usually much higher as well. The data centers at the providers are usually very robust, all kinds of redundant servers, and networks, and various other systems to enhance the reliability and improve the quality of service.

And finally, some of the strategic benefits, perhaps most notably bypassing the IT infrastructure investment, those capital expenditures that an organization might have to make can go away and we can move much more toward an operational expenditure type of model as opposed to a capital expenditure type of model. So bypassing that can save huge amounts of money. And the speed of competition and in some cases, this is referred to release to market. Now if it's something like an application that you are developing, then you can use cloud services as your platform for developing that and it's available immediately. You don't have to set up your own internal development environment with huge amounts of infrastructure and software. It's already there available. So you can immediately start working on a product and probably get it to market much more quickly, than if you were working on it internally. So again, a number of benefits provided by cloud solutions.

### Disadvantages to Using Cloud Computing
Despite the possible benefits of cloud computing, of course, nothing is perfect, so there may also be some potential disadvantages. And they include things, such as ambiguity. And with this, it's simply the fact that cloud services are relatively new and a lot of people may not understand what the technology is all about, what it represents, and why you might want to move to a cloud solution. So that lack of understanding can translate into hesitation or possibly even fear of going that route. So that can certainly cause a problem. Limited support for customization, now this depends on what it is you're talking about. But as an example, if you were wanting to implement something like a customer management application, for starters, there may only be one option for that application. And in terms of customizing it, you might not be able to do so at all because the application is being shared by multiple different customers. So you might not have the option to customize it the way that you might if you were implementing it internally.

Similarly, constraints on features, within any given service or application you might want to implement this particular option, it may not be there. So again, kind of the same idea as the limited support for customization. It does depend, but a particular feature that you might know about in terms of an internal implementation just may not be available in a cloud version. Latency is always something to consider, and this refers to a time delay when it comes to the actual performance of an application or a service. You are, at the end of the day, relying on the Internet to access your applications and services in the cloud, which, of course, is, you know, not the most reliable technology nor is it the fastest performing technology. So you might get a significant delay in how quickly an application responds, or in downloading large files, or uploading a lot of database records, things like that, just may not perform well enough. In terms then of some considerations for implementing your cloud-based solution that you have to take into account those possible disadvantages with these other considerations, such as privacy and security.

Every provider will certainly tell you that your data is safe, and secure, and that you own it. But ultimately your data is under the control of a third party. It is not at your location. It's there at the provider's location. So how assured are you that it is being kept secure and, you know, private, not only from other customers but from the employees of the service provider. The network configuration, you know, does your network configuration support being able to connect and integrate with the providers? And finally, cloud regulations and federal concerns. A lot of organizations are constrained from using cloud services because they, for example, are not allowed to store data off-site with somebody else. So there are a number of regulations that haven't yet been fully adopted as standards with respect to cloud computing. But there are a lot of privacy laws and sharing of data regulations that you do have to take into account. Again, dependent on your organization but, in some cases, you may not even be able to go with cloud solutions. So all of those things need to be considered before a move to the cloud occurs.

### Regulatory and Compliance Issues
If you are considering a move to a cloud-based solution, then you definitely need to be aware of some compliance and regulatory issues. Now primarily, what this involves is reduced governance control. In other words, there are typically lower levels of governance control for cloud consumers versus on-premise IT resources. When you have something like, let's just say, data storage in your own organization, you have full and complete control over how that data is managed and accessed. When it's in a cloud-type environment, you really don't because it is no longer in your physical location, it's somewhere else. So there is this lower level of governance. So there's a possible risk with how any given cloud provider operates its cloud and any required external connections between the cloud and the cloud consumer. Of course, you're always using the Internet to access this data. So that introduces another very public network in between you and the data and that possibly presents an issue with respect to these compliance and regulatory concerns.

So you definitely need to be aware of whether or not you are able to store data in that kind of manner. Also, things like multiregional compliance, it might be a very affordable and convenient geographical location, but that may introduce serious legal conflicts with industry or government regulations. So again, specifically with things like data privacy and storage policies, depending on the type of information your organization manages, you may not even be allowed to move the data from your physical premises. If you were to do so, you may have violated some significant and serious privacy laws, things, such as health records, credit card information, or any kind of purchasing type of data, things like that.

So in terms of accessibility and disclosure of data, full responsibility is typically on the cloud customer, not the provider. You know, the provider simply says yes, we can store data. That's fine, but whether or not, you're allowed to place that data with the cloud provider is, you know, is your responsibility to know that. So it's definitely something that you have to look into. There are a lot of resources that are available for you to research, but you certainly need to determine what kind of information your organization handles and whether or not it is acceptable to move that information off of your physical premises to someone else's location.

### Security in Cloud Computing
Security is, of course, a primary concern of any organization. And when it comes to cloud computing, the providers will typically implement a various number of security controls to try to mitigate those concerns as best as possible. And they include such things as deterrent controls, which are in essence a warning sign, if you will, that anyone who does attempt to circumvent the security will face, you know, severe and adverse consequences. Preventative controls, which are designed to fight out, prevent an attack in the first place, so things like strong authentication mechanisms and tightly-controlled authorization policies to ensure that only the appropriate people are gaining access to only the appropriate content. Detective controls are literally meant to detect unusual and malicious activity and generally respond in some kind of manner, such as an intrusion detection system for the network. And corrective controls, which are designed more so to just minimize the damage. If a breach does occur, let's make sure that we can limit the damage to as little as possible, restoring systems back to previous states, for example.

As far as the risks go, you definitely need to be aware of what they are, and they certainly can include things like data breaches. Somebody else gaining access to the data that, of course, should not be able to have access in the first place. Data loss, somebody actually removing data, so it's flat out stolen or just gone. Account or service traffic hijacking, somebody else making use of your service through some kind of malicious means, so they are posing as a valid user, for example. Insecure interfaces and APIs, if you are looking to do secure transactions or just transfer data in a secure fashion, you need to make sure whatever application programming interface is being used is, of course, properly secured. Denial of service, simply not being able to access a particular application or a service. Malicious insiders, obviously the service provider themselves do have physical access to the computers, the data storage, the network. So if there is a malicious insider, then there's certainly a risk there.

Simple cloud abuse, just misusing the services for malicious means. And again that can include things like obviously a malicious insider, but there might be a case wherein somebody is using a virtual machine on, let's say, a physical server to access virtual machines on that same server that belong to other users, other customers. So you know, depending on its configuration, there may be some possible loopholes wherein somebody is using one part of their service to gain access to somebody else's service. Insufficient due diligence, you know, simply the customer not being aware of all these risks and not being aware of whether or not the provider is appropriately mitigating that risk. And finally, shared technology vulnerabilities...again at the end of the day, cloud services are multitenant. There are multiple customers using the same technologies as you, and that can simply prevent some vulnerabilities. So like anything, you need to be aware of the risks. You need to be aware of how these risks are being mitigated so that you can effectively decide if this is an appropriate solution for your organization.

### Usage Scenarios for Cloud Computing
Looking at some of the usage scenarios for cloud computing, one of the common places that you'll see it is a startup company with a fairly basic IT need in terms of their infrastructure. They're generally fairly basic, so outsourcing the entire IT infrastructure to a cloud service provider frees up time and resources for focusing on your core business competencies and various strategies and gives you the benefit of scalability as your business and needs grow. In other words, a startup company just, in a lot of cases, doesn't have the means nor maybe the expertise to implement an entire IT infrastructure. So simply outsourcing it to a cloud provider presents a very good solution. Let's just not even concern ourselves with creating this IT infrastructure. Let's focus on what we know, what we're doing, and leave the IT to someone else. Organizations with widely fluctuating needs...cloud computing is a practical option if the IT department regularly needs to, what is referred to as "burst", in other words, accessing extra IT resources to meet a temporary increase in resource needs, and that might happen if, for example, you see here the needs include scalability testing of internally-developed applications and/or evaluation of suitability of any kind of atypical software.

So you might not have the means to do those kinds of things within your own internal organization. Cloud computing might be a viable option. Organizations that are unsure of demand for their services and this is a very good example. You can benefit from elasticity of cloud computing solutions. They are very flexible. You really have no idea what kind of demand, let's say, your web-based application or web site is going to encounter, then the flexibility of the cloud really alleviates this issue because you can allocate more resources whenever you want, and you can then deallocate those resources if it turns out you don't need them. So as an example we see here, outsourcing the infrastructure to a cloud provider while managing and operating applications and servers internally. And based on demand, expand or reduce the cloud services. Application delivery controllers, or ADCs, and other acceleration devices can be used to guarantee the performance. Load balancing, SSL security, support caching, and compression, just all of these things, all of these features are readily available within the cloud but maybe not so much within your own internal organization. So you know, again for those unexpected increases in demand or just not really having any idea what is going to be in the first place, all of these features are available easily within a cloud environment.

And finally, very large enterprises, you might see private clouds here to distribute their own IT resources. So the thought process here is that we've already got our own robust data center. Let's provide the services and the capabilities of that data center to some of our regional offices, or some of our other branches, or other divisions. So it's the same kind of model as a cloud; it's just done internally. This provides a secure centralized infrastructure for hosting applications. You still get the benefits of reduction in costs, energy consumption, staffing, and hardware requirements because again you don't need to outfit all of those other branch locations with their own IT equipment and their own IT departments. You simply subscribe to the corporate headquarters, if you will. So a number of different scenarios, and possibly one of those scenarios might fit with your organization.

### Exercise: Deciding to Move to the Cloud

### Exercise Overview

So using what has been covered in this course, we would like you to take a few minutes now to perform an exercise, wherein we'll ask you to prepare some responses to the following questions with respect to cloud computing and moving your business to the cloud. So for starters, what are the deployment models for cloud computing? What are the service models for cloud computing and their benefits? What are some obstacles that need to be taken into consideration when deciding if your business should move to the cloud? And how are costs evaluated and how does it add value to a business? So what we would like you to do is to take a few moments and prepare these responses and then we'll come back and we'll go through your answers in a few minutes.

### Solution

Okay, so here are some possible solutions and/or answers to those responses. And the first question was what are the deployment models for cloud computing? And the answer, there are the three primary models of public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud. Now there were a few other considerations, such as community cloud, but these are typically what you see when discussing cloud services. So the first thing really is to determine which type of cloud might best suit your needs. And public clouds, as the name suggests, available to anyone.

Private cloud, something that's created and maintained within an internal organization. And a hybrid cloud, a mix of both of them. The next question was what are the service models for cloud computing and their benefits? And the three primary models here are Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Infrastructure as a Service. Now the benefits for each one are going to vary, so there is no set answer there. But Software as a Service provides you with applications that you can leverage. Platform as a Service typically provides you with a development environment, and Infrastructure as a Service provides you with the necessary foundation upon which you can build everything else. But the primary benefit of all of them is simply the ability to leverage an in-place infrastructure that somebody else already has, and you can really reduce, possibly eliminate, capital expenditures in favor of operational expenditures, which usually carry less risk, and, of course, a lower amount. Then we asked what are some obstacles that you need to take into consideration when deciding if your business should move to the cloud, and there, again, you'll find a number of possibilities. But in terms of the types of obstacles, you typically might encounter technical obstacles to adopt the technology in the first place,

then some obstacles with respect to how it can grow, there may be policy and business obstacles, and there may be behavioral obstacles to adopting a new technology as well. So again there can be a number of different concerns within those, but those are some of the primary categories. And finally, how are costs evaluated and how does it add value to a business? Well, there was the basic equation of the value of the cloud being equal to the revenue that you'll expect or at least hope it will generate minus, of course, what the cost of the service is. So those are hopefully numbers that you can actually assign based on what the provider can tell you, and, of course, what you anticipate in terms of revenue. But with respect to adding value to the business, the usage-based pricing, the elasticity or flexibility, and the transference of risk, particularly where capital expenditures are concerned, can really help to add value to your business. So again, there are some variances with all answers, but hopefully you came up with something that was fairly similar to those responses.

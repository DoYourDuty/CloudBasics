### Identity and Access Management Basic Concepts
In this video, I'll cover identity and access management basic concepts. With identity and access management, we have the use and management of the same identity information for all our applications. It's used to authenticate users, or devices, or services, and to grant them or deny them rights to data and other system resources. So each application, system, or service then does not require its own identity store or its own security authentication mechanisms because they would be configured to trust our identity provider to do those things. So identity and access management simplifies the management of large-scale distributed systems, and they could be used within an enterprise or outside of an enterprise in a business-to-business relationship or even between a private enterprise and a cloud provider. There are three main concepts related to identity and access management or IAM. The first is authentication. Authentication verifies the identity of a user, device, or service.
Heading: Identity and Access Management.

Identity and access management ensures appropriate access to enterprise resources.

This could be as simple as supplying a username and password, or we might also require a PKI digital certificate on a device, or we might use a hardware token for authentication. There are many variations. The second concept is authorization, and this can only occur after a successful authentication. Authorization establishes the appropriate privileges that, for example, a user would need to perform a specific action in a web application. The third main concept is auditing, whereby we record all actions that take place from authentication through to privilege use. A trust boundary is a virtual perimeter or a jurisdiction of control for identities that might fall under the realm of the IT department. So it might be a data center. It might be a specific application or a network. With cloud services access control, we could extend our trust boundary to the service provider domain level. We might do this so that, for example, users that are successfully authenticated on-premises with their user account can then seamlessly access cloud services without us re-creating those user credentials in the cloud.

With identity and access management, we also have the option of using higher-level software controls. When we think about running cloud services to a degree for a private organization or an individual, there is a loss of direct control, in some cases, of data or networks. With higher-level software controls, which means it's driven through policies, we can configure access that is allowed to certain applications after successful authentication, and in this way, it reduces the risk vulnerability. In this video, we covered identity and access management basic concepts.

### Reasons for Identity Federation
In this video, I'll talk about the reasons that drive the need for identity federation. Identity federation is the practice of negotiating interactions between entities that could be separated by an organization's internal and external trust relationships. But bear in mind, identity federation could also be used within a single organization. This negotiating of interactions usually takes the form of authenticating a user, for example, and then authorizing that user to access multiple applications. Identity federation eases the introduction of identity and access management with cloud computing in an organization. It also strengthens the authentication process, and one of the reasons this is true is because with identity federation, we've got a centralized identity provider. So we might have an on-premises user account server, and after successful authentication, users might be authorized to use applications within the organization but also outside of the organization, perhaps in a cloud provider environment. This way we don't have multiple copies of user accounts and passwords. This means it's less confusing for users because they don't have to remember different passwords, and it's easier from the management standpoint. So in this way, it strengthens the authentication process.

Identity federation could be implemented in a number of ways. One of those ways is web-based Single Sign-On or SSO. After a successful authentication, a user, or a device, or a service would then be authorized to access other applications without having to authenticate again, and that's because of our centralized identity provider. Delegation could also be used, whereby we could use a set of credentials to authenticate to a totally different system instead of having unique credentials within each system. An example of this that we have probably all seen on the Internet is being able to sign in to a site using our Facebook or Twitter accounts instead of setting up a username and password on a specific web site. We can also use a centralized access control service for entitlement management that would also perhaps support role-based security access. So this might be provided as a cloud service.

Identity federation also means improved operational efficiency because we can automate processes, such as user onboarding. For example, when an organization hires new employees, once the new employee username is input into, for example, a web page, that could trigger a number of other processes that add them to the appropriate groups and make sure that they are authorized to use various applications. So we might have that user onboarding create a user account only once in a centralized identity provider. For repetitive tasks, such as resetting passwords, unlocking accounts, or adding users to or from groups, we could also automate that. Identity federation might also be required for regulatory compliance. So we need to make sure that an organization adheres to laws and regulations surrounding data protection and privacy. This also helps defend from internal and external threats at the network level, the individual system level, application level, and even at the level of working with the data that is a result of using those applications.

So identity federation scales well because we have a central way to authenticate users, devices, or services, and then we have other systems, or networks, or web applications that trust our centralized identity provider. In this video, we talked about the reasons that drive the need for identity federation.

### Identity and Access Management Operational Areas
There are number of operational areas related to identity and access management. In this video, we'll explore each of those operational areas. Identity and access management operational areas include identity management and provisioning, authentication management, federated identity management, authorization management, and finally, compliance management. Let's examine each of these in detail beginning with identity management and provisioning. This ensures that authorized users are securely and effectively incorporated into a cloud and that unauthorized users are not. So this means that we have to have a solid way of ensuring that accounts that get created are legitimate and that they're configured accordingly so they have access to the resources they should have access to. Authorized users consist of different types of users like IT administrators, managers, end users, but authorized users could also include services or devices. The Service Provisioning Markup Language, SPML, is an XML-based framework that's used for identity management. It exchanges user, resource, and service provisioning information between organizations.

It's superseded by the Simple Cloud Identity Management, or SCIM, standard, which aims to address some of the shortcomings of SPML. Now one of the shortcomings of SPML is the fact that it uses multiple proprietary protocols from varying vendors, and this means that we've got a bunch of different APIs. They're not all the same and it makes it difficult to make them interact. Now with SCIM, this is a universal standard for user provisioning and access management where we don't have that type of problem. The second operational area of identity and access management is authentication management. Authentication means approving of one's identity. We need to ensure that credentials, such as passwords and digital certificates, are managed securely. We also want to make sure that user credentials are protected from malicious attacks like brute force, dictionary-based attacks, and the manipulation of password-reset services. Often, one of the ways that that's handled is using out-of-band confirmation of the owner of the user account may be by sending a text message to a phone number with a code that is used to reset a password.

The cloud service users need to be also protected from phishing attacks. The best way to prevent this is through user education as well as some mail filtering programs. A phishing attack attempts to deceive or trick a user, often, in the form of an e-mail message that looks legitimate, but when the user clicks a link in the message, it's taking them to a fraudulent site. We also need to make sure that we enforce strong password policies or if we're not using only passwords that we have policies that require perhaps smartcard authentication or even hardware or software token authentication, we need to think about protecting high-risk resources, applications, and assets. One of the best ways to ensure security is using one time passwords, which are never repeated and impossible to break. Digital PKI certificates are very difficult to forge, and they can be issued to users, devices, or services. They are often used in addition to another authentication mechanism like username and password. The next operational area of identity and access management is Federated Identity Management.

This means that we can authenticate cloud service users using the organization's selected identity provider. Now that selected identity provider might even be on-premises on a server owned by the organization. For example, in a Microsoft shop, that could be an active directory server on the company network that authenticates users, and then they get authorized to access cloud services on the cloud provider network. Credentials and attributes are transmitted between the identity provider and the service provider. Now in some cases depending on our configuration, we're not actually sending credentials, but rather may be attributes. Now attributes are statements or assertions about, for example, a user such as this user is a part of this group or this user has a specific date of birth as follows and those are called claims. Some applications consume these claims and therefore our identity provider would have to be configured to extract those attributes and transmit them where required by applications.

Federated identity management also ensures privacy, integrity, and non-repudiation. One of the reasons is because the trust between an application, such as a web-based application and the identity provider, can be established by exchanging PKI certificate public keys. We even have the option of configuring encryption so that when we transmit credentials or claim attributes, they are protected when they're being sent. Single Sign-On, or SSO, is a big part of Federated cloud services. This can be done publicly or privately. This means that we might authenticate users and then they'll be authorized to access numerous apps either internally to the organization or even externally to the cloud. Another operational area is authorization management. Now remember that authentication verifies the identity of an entity like a user, a device, or a service. But authorization occurs after successful authentication and it determines what that entity is allowed to do within a given application. So it establishes access rights that a connecting entity has to the requested resource. That requested resource might be a web application.

The eXtensible Access Control Markup Language, or XACML, is based on standards that are set out by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards otherwise known as OASIS. And many identity federation solutions use this when it comes to authorization management. XML creates a model for consistent XACML language that allows the management of policies through a processing environment. XML is a standard information interchange mechanism, whereby it doesn't matter what the operating system platform or the applications are using on either end of a connection. The last operational area of identity and access management is compliance management. With this, we can ensure that an organization's resources are secure and accessed in accordance with existing policies and regulations. Now, of course, that will vary from industry-to-industry or from one government agency to another. We also have the option of monitoring and auditing access rights and privileges of entities accessing those resources. We could implement internal access control policies; we could also implement and even automate standard such as periodic reporting on privilege use.

We could take a look at segregation of duties for enhanced security. We could also monitor access to resources when they occur. We might even configure alerts to be triggered whenever any of these things happen or when a certain amount or volume of these activities occurs. In this video, we discussed identity and access management operational areas.

### Cloud Service Providers and IAM
In this video, I'll discuss cloud service providers and Identity Access Management. In the cloud, Software as a Service, or SaaS, can provide its own user authentication, which is based on network trust level, or it could use some external entity to do the authentication, such as an on-premises identity provider owned by an organization. With a centrally hosted provider that means that we've got user account credentials or device or service account credentials stored centrally that could also be done in the cloud. Software as a Service is a subscription-based service, where we pay for what we use and it could include accessing e-mail in the cloud, or storage in the cloud, or using Office productivity tools in the cloud, and so on. Platform as a Service, or PaaS, allows cloud service providers to delegate their authentication duties to a third party or to perform authentication themselves. The third party could even be an organization's on-premises identity provider configuration. Authentication methods for Platform as a Service often use web-based APIs because they are standard.

If a cloud service provider delegates authentication, then an authentication protocol should be used for communication. One of the most commonly used standards for authentication protocol communication is SAML, the Security Assertion Markup Language. Identity Federation solutions will support SAML in addition to other web-based protocols. Infrastructure as a Service or IaaS caters to IT personnel that need to deploy and manage organizational applications and resources, such as virtual networks and storage in the cloud as well. It leverages existing systems in an organization's corporate network. One of the ways that this is possible is by using an on-premises authentication provider. Now we could accomplish this using a dedicated VPN from the customer network to the cloud network if required or we could use an LDAP directory to authenticate users, devices, or services. One of the great things about a dedicated VPN when linking a customer network to a cloud network is that the customers can then migrate on-premises IT services to the cloud while keeping the original IP configuration. At the same time, we could also ensure that data is protected because it's going through an encrypted VPN tunnel.

With Infrastructure as a Service, the organization can also decide how to authenticate application users. Now again that could be done on-premises, whereby the cloud service would trust our on-premises identity provider or we might have user identities stored solely in the cloud. Cloud-based standards should be supported and considered for flexibility. An example of this would be SPML, which is used to provision user identities and access permissions within as well as across organizational boundaries. In this video, we discussed cloud service providers and Identity Access Management.

### Federation Overview
In this video, I'll do a federation overview. Identity federation is the practice of negotiating interactions between entities that are separated by an organization's internal and external trust relationships. These entities could take multiple forms. For example, let's say that we've got an identity provider entity, whereby we store user accounts and that's where users get authenticated. On the other side of entities, we might have a web application that doesn't have its own user accounts or authentication, but it could trust our identity provider. So after successful authentication, users would then be authorized to use that web application. Now this could happen within an organization or even between separate organizations that have a trust relationship established. That trust relationship is often established by exchanging PKI public keys between two organizations. Identity federation is also used to manage access controls when two or more geographically separate entities attempt to share resources and services. So for example, we could have an on-premises user account database owned by a company. Then after authentication those users would be authorized to access applications in the cloud, which could be far away geographically.

A federation can also enable an entity to access a service or resource hosted inside another company's cloud or trust boundaries. So we don't necessarily have to have identity federation between our on-premises customer network and the cloud provider. It could also be between two private sector businesses or two government agencies. The benefits of federation and access control include allowing clients to optimize enterprise IT service delivery. One of the big items related to IT service delivery is to deliver IT services effectively, efficiently, and in a cost effective manner in a timely fashion. Now that can be done because with federation, we've got centralized identity providers. It also allows clients to choose the best cloud service provider in terms of flexibility, cost, and availability. For those issues, we might take a look at the cloud providers Service Level Agreement, or SLA. Another benefit is that applications can run in the most appropriate infrastructure environments. It might be more appropriate, for example, to have an application that we're currently running on-premises instead to run in the public cloud. This might be because of the economies of scale where it's cheap for us to pay for additional storage or additional virtual machines for our application as needed.

Now if we were doing that on-premises, we would have to order the appropriate equipment configure it, we would be responsible for maintaining it, and so on. So it might be more appropriate to run those types of applications that will scale in a different infrastructure such as a cloud provider's infrastructure. Federation and access control also allow for distributed workloads whereby the authentication would take place on one provider's network. That could even be on-premises for an organization and the actual application itself is running elsewhere maybe in the cloud or in another company's network. Federation can be implicit or explicit. Implicit means that the requesting entity has to connect to the resource using a portal. Now the requesting entity is normally a user using a web browser on their device. So this means with implicit connections that there's no direct communication between the entity, the user using a web browser, and the resource, which would be a web application. So instead they would go through a middleman and that middleman would be the federation server.

With explicit federation, requesting entities are aware of the federation process. This type of federation can occur even over the Internet when an entity requests access to a resource, but still has a direct connection to it. So for example, when an entity, such as a user using a web browser attempting to access a web application, when they connect to that web site they might be presented with an area where they can provide authentication credentials. However, those authentication credentials might not be a part of that application at all even though it appears to the end user that they are. Those credentials might be actually checked through a federation server, and then afterwards, after successful authentication in some environments, the federation server might even provide the user station with a web browser cookie, which is then presented to the web application for authorized access. In this video, we did a federation overview.

### Cloud Federation Considerations
Before configuring cloud federation, there are many considerations that need to be taken into account. In this video, we will examine some of those considerations beginning with Single Sign-On, or SSO. We should consider using Single Sign-On if employees within an organization need to have access to multiple resources that require authentication. So those multiple resources could be web applications, and, of course, they would not have any way to authenticate users themselves. Instead, they will be configured to trust a centralized identity provider. Therefore, once users are successfully authenticated through that identity provider, they have seamless access to those web applications without logging in again. Single Sign-On can be implemented using an authentication server hosted by the organization or it could be hosted in the cloud provider's network. Either way the server would transmit user credentials or it would transmit an authentication token to the client that's requesting a resource, and that client would then present the token to the cloud service resource it's trying to gain access to.

We could also use tunneling technologies to connect a cloud network with an on-premises network. This could be done at either Layer 2 or Layer 3 of the OSI model. Layer 2 refers to the use of MAC addresses, which are unique hardware addresses burned in the network cards. Layer 3 refers to software or IP addresses. Now using a Layer 2 tunnel between a customer on-premises network and a cloud provider network would allow us to have a point-to-point link such that devices on either side, so on the on-premises network as well as in the cloud provider network, could actually be configured as if they were on the exact same local area network because at the addressing level, it appears that way. However, really they are a distributed network. With Layer 3 IP addressing and tunneling technologies, we could migrate services from on-premises to the cloud to retain the original IP addressing of those services. This way, for example, an on-premises client could connect as if the servers were still on-premises. Traffic transmitted through this type of tunnel can also be encrypted for additional security.

We should also consider the use of computer and storage resources both locally on-premises as well as in the cloud. With cloud-based computer and storage resources, we have to consider also our Internet connection to the cloud provider. As an example, let's say that we decide we're going to use cloud-based backup.  What we need to make sure that our Internet link is fast enough to accommodate the amount of data that we need to back up to the cloud on our backup schedule. Some of this type of information could be outlined in a Service Level Agreement, or an SLA, which is really just a contract between the cloud provider and the cloud customer. Oftentimes, the items within the SLA are negotiable. So we would need to consider whether we're going to be using things like virtual machines in the cloud or whether or not we're going to be using databases in the cloud as opposed to or in addition to on-premises. And for smaller organizations, we might even consider using Identity & Access Management entirely in the cloud, where we don't already have an on-premises identity server.

On the webpage, "Amazon Web Services" text is displayed. This webpage includes sections such as Compute, Administration & Security, Database, Mobile Services, and so on. The Compute section includes the following options: EC2, Lambda, EC2 Container Service.

The presenter clicks the Identity & Access Management option, and the IAM Management Console page is displayed. He then navigates to the Active Directory - Micros... tab in the Google Chrome browser window. The name of the tab appears partially.

At the same time, if we've already got, for example, Microsoft ACTIVE DIRECTORY on-premises, we might go to a cloud provider whereby we could link our on-premises active directory with a directory service in the cloud. This way we could use the same user accounts in groups in the cloud that we already have on-premises. Of course, we also need to consider how we're going to be paying for our cloud services. Most cloud providers have an interface where you can manage billing and reconciliation to see where charges came from. Per-use billing means that we are paying for what we are using and it's dependent upon the IT workload. For instance, we might fire up a virtual machine in the cloud yet even if nobody accesses it at all, we still might be charged a fee for it. We might also be charged a higher fee if it's actually being used. So for those details, we would have to look through our Service Level Agreement with our cloud provider. We should also conduct periodic evaluations of deployed cloud services to ensure that their existence is still required.

Occasionally, we might have virtual machines or user accounts provisioned in the cloud that might be used for a period, but then they are no longer used in the future. We want to make sure we're not paying for these type of services whereby they're not being used at all. Providers will also give us options to set cloud service usage caps much like you might use on a smartphone, you might set a mobile data cap. If you have a 2 GB plan per month, for example, you want to make sure you get warmed up maybe 1.75 GB of data usage through a mobile network. We can do the same type of thing in the cloud. We configure thresholds. We configure alerts and notifications so that we know we're about to undertake cost overruns with our cloud service usage. Most cloud providers will provide some kind of a billing Dashboard, where you can manage your costs, view Bill Details, and also configure Alerts & Notifications. In this video, we discussed cloud federation considerations.

### Standards Based Federation
In this video, I'll discuss standards-based federation. The goal of federation in web services is to receive identity and attribute information from security and identity token services without requiring direct input from users. This is also designed to work across different networks that might be using different operating system platforms and different types of applications. So it's crucial that we use standards for this interoperability to succeed. Federation metadata that describes federated service information and communication policies has to be shared between parties. For example, we might need to do this if we want to connect one organization's identity provider with web applications that will trust that provider in a second organization. This federation metadata could be exchanged by exporting information from one site and importing it to the other or even connecting to a specially formatted URL on another organization's federation server, where we could retrieve information about that federation configuration.

Trust information is negotiated via a security token exchange. This also needs to be shared. Often, what happens is we exchange public key information, which is stored in a PKI digital certificate. This is often done because an identity provider will often digitally sign authenticated user information and that digitally signed token is what sent off to trusting web applications. All those web applications need to trust that signature. And one way to trust a digital signature is to use the public key of the signer to verify that the signature is valid. So we would make sure that we did this, especially if we're using different types of systems in different organizations to establish trust. We might have one company using Active Directory Federation Services; we might have another company using a Unix-based federation solution, such as Shibboleth. Identity federation commonly occurs between authentication and authorization services. So we might have identities, such as user accounts, stored in one organization. But after successful authentication, they need to be authorized to use applications in another organization,

which could also be a cloud provider. A basic model for identity federation includes standards, such as the web services security, web services trust, and web services security policy standards. Using this type of model, we can create assertions or claims about a requesting entity in the form of security tokens. So, for example, when a user attempts to access a federated web application, that web application might redirect the user authentication request to a federation server. Now this can be completely transparent to the user. What would then happen is the user is then authenticated through the identity provider. And the identity provider might retrieve additional attributes about that authenticated user. Those are called assertions or claims. For example, if the web application requires a date of birth, may be upon authentication, the identity provider will extract the date of birth, where it's stored somewhere for that user. That information is then placed together into what's called a claim, which would be digitally signed by the identity provider. Remember, the trusting web application would trust signatures from that identity provider because it verifies the signatures using a public key. Signatures are created using a related private key.

These security tokens in association with security policies are what establish a trust relationship that protects web services. We might also configure encryption. So not only would we be digitally signing security tokens, but we might also be encrypting them for confidentiality reasons. S-Security is a service specification that extends the Simple Object Access Protocol. This specification can be extended through the use of others, such as web services federation. When we configure identity federation, we'll have many options to choose from different standards, including the transmission of SOAP messages. Web services federation extends web services security. In that, it allows entities in one secure environment to access resources managed in another secure environment. Now remember, those two environments might be two completely separate organizations. So there needs to be some trust established for this to happen, and often, remember, that happens by exchanging PKI public keys.

Web services federation asserts identities or builds claims. Now this happens on the identity provider's side because those claims are consumed by specific web applications that trust the identity provider. Discovering attributes that will be placed into claims, such as date of birth or other groups that a user is a member of, would come from some kind of a source like an LDAP directory or some kind of a database, even Active Directory in a Microsoft environment. Web services federation authorizes requests between federating entities. STS stands for Security Token Service. This is commonly used with federated identity management. In that, an identity provider digitally signs security tokens after successful authentication with a private key. On the other end, a relying party would verify that signature with the public key before allowing access to an application.

Web services federation can also be extended to web browser platforms, so that they can communicate WS or Web services trust token issuing messages to applications that require them. In some configurations, this comes in the form of an HTTP redirect with a web browser cookie. So once the user is successfully authenticated and a claim is created by the identity provider and digitally signed, then the user is sent an HTTP redirect, so that their client browser can go back to the original web site they were trying to access and can present something in the form of a security tool, which could come in the form of a web browser cookie. In this video, we discussed standards-based federation.

### Single Sign-On Overview
In this video, I'll discuss Single Sign-On. Single Sign-On, or SSO, is an authentication process that requires each user to have only one username and password, which can then be used to access multiple applications. Now those applications normally are web-based, but there are some federation solutions that allow you to configure SSO for non-web-based applications. SSO can be configured to be used only for certain groups of applications. Each of these applications would have to be configured to trust and centralize identity provider. Users need to follow traditional methods to sign into applications that require stricter security. One of the benefits of Single Sign-On is that applications might not even have their own authentication mechanism. In other cases, they may. This is referred to as reduced sign-on and it reduces the number of passwords that users have to remember because once a user authenticates once centrally, they won't be prompted for credentials for other accessing of resources.

With workflow process, this can be used to make SSO very simple and effective. It forms a part of an identity and access management solution that automates Single Sign-On task management. For example, we could automate the fact that when a user gets provisioned, they have access to a specific number of applications based on group membership. A workflow process can also automatically check a requesting user's access rights to an application. With web-based Single Sign-On, we have a standard method of authenticating online users across multiple platforms and even between organizational boundaries. This allows users to navigate between web pages without having to reauthenticate themselves constantly. Non web-based Single Sign-On is used for legacy applications, but, yet, this is more rare than web-based SSO. In this video, we discussed Single Sign-On.

Benefits and Risks of Single Sign-On
Most technology solutions are double-edged swords. So we have to take the good along with the bad. In this video, we'll discuss both the benefits as well as the risks of Single Sign-On. There are commercial benefits of Single Sign-On technology. For example, e-commerce companies can use Single Sign-On to enable users to set up their own accounts. Also, user access privileges can be automatically created based on individual attributes and business security policies and rules. So once a user is authenticated, we can look at attributes related to that user to make those kinds of decisions. Accounts can be used to access services from different web sites while maintaining site security and integrity. So we've all seen on the Internet, where we can authenticate to various different web sites using a Facebook account, or a Twitter account, or we might sign in with our Office 365 or our Google account, and we can access multiple applications without keeping on having to sign in over and over.

There are efficiency benefits related to Single Sign-On as well. We can incorporate Single Sign-On to speed up application development lifecycle. For developers, this means that they don't have to build in authentication into their code. Instead, their application can be configured to trust an identity provider elsewhere, where the authentication takes place. However, with the good comes the bad. There are potential security threats with Single Sign-On. One is that there could be a perceived increase in risk because unauthorized users that obtain a single password would then be able to access all of the resources that that account gets access to. Passwords are often vulnerable because users tend to write them down, especially the complicated ones. It's almost self-defeating. The more complex the password requirements, the easy it could be for someone to determine the password because a user might write it on a sticky note and put that under their keyboard or under their desk.

There are also the potential for attacks on service providers that host passwords. Those attacks might take place through social engineering, or the tricking of people, or that could be a compromise on a directory service that contains all user authentication credentials. So because we're looking at having a single instance or a centralized identity store, that store becomes a larger target for malicious users. We also have to consider the fact that introducing Single Sign-On into existing legacy applications could be difficult. Single Sign-On, really, is designed to work best with web-based applications. We have to think about the reduction of security risks by integrating Single Sign-On with other technologies. This way we have a single or centralized authentication mechanism. But, of course, that means we have to take extra steps to harden or secure our centralized identity provider.

We also have the option of implementing cryptographic authentication, for example, using PKI certificates. Through this, we could configure authentication so that we can trust or validate the trustworthiness of messages. We can also use encryption to hide or scramble data from unauthorized users as is being transmitted through Single Sign-On networks. We can also use security tokens as an authentication method. The security token could take the form of a physical hardware token or it could be a soft token. It could be an app, for example, running on a smartphone. These tokens would have a numeric code that changes in sync with a server-side element. And so within a certain time frame, we would have to provide our credentials as well as that unique numeric code. In this video, we discussed the benefits and risks of Single Sign-On.

### Identity as a Service Overview
In this video, I'll discuss Identity as a Service. There are various types of identities. There are internal users that are those that form part of an organization, such as employees and maintenance personnel. Then there are external users, who are those that are using a service or a product offered by an organization. For example, this could be business partners and individuals in its customer base. Then there are consumers. These are users that use authentication mechanisms while using social networking tools, such as Facebook or services provided by providers, such as Google. Identity and Access Management, or IAM, uses entity federation. Federation involves establishing and managing the identities and trust relationships of users, devices, and services in the cloud. By far, the most common use of identity federation is for user accounts. Organizations could outsource their identity management instead of handling it in-house or they could even replicate their on-premises identities to the cloud.

Cloud providers will often give you the option of creating a directory service hosted entirely in the cloud, where you could create user accounts or you could create some kind of a connector with your on-premises directory service. That way, people could continue to authenticate with their existing credentials you have on-premises, but that is being replicated to the cloud to facilitate Single Sign-On for authorization to cloud services. So we have the option of using Identity and Access Management through a cloud provider to build user accounts that entirely exist in the cloud. They're not stored on-premises anywhere. This way, those accounts could be used for authentication and then access to cloud services. Outsourcing Identity and Access Management can be useful, if a third party like a cloud provider is better equipped at facilitating multiprotocol federation. For example, between partners and clouds that might span multiple legal jurisdictions.
The presenter opens the Google Chrome browser window. The AWS Directory Service tabbed page is displayed in the browser window.

This tabbed page includes the Directory Setup section that contains the following steps: Step 1:Directory Type, Step 2: Directory Details, and Step 3: Review. The Step 1: Directory Type is selected by default and the following sections are displayed along with the description for each: Create a Simple AD and Connect using AD Connector.

The Create a Simple AD section includes the Create Simple AD button and the Connect using AD Connector section includes the Create AD Connector button.

He then opens the IAM Management Console tabbed page in the Google Chrome browser window. This tabbed page includes the Dashboard section in the left pane that includes options such as Details, Groups, and Users. The Details option is selected by default. The corresponding right pane includes the heading "Welcome to Identity and Access Management" and the following sections: IAM Resources and Security Status.

The IAM Resources section includes links such as Users, Roles, and Groups. The presenter clicks the Users link and as a result, the Users page is displayed. This page includes the following buttons: Create New Users and User Actions. He clicks the Create New Users button.

As a result, the Create User page is displayed that includes five text boxes for 'Enter User Names:' and the Generate an access key for each user checkbox. In addition, it includes the Cancel and Create buttons.

Identity as a Service, or IDaaS, would involve a third party, such as a web-hosted service that manages access control and identity federation in the cloud. The process occurs separately from applications that use those identities. We can also have a hybrid solution where we have a link between organizations and cloud service providers. We might manage identities internally on our own on-premises network, and then that could be used to authenticate users, and then give them access to cloud-based services. Remember, we also have the option of replicating on-premises identities to the cloud to allow that access to occur. In this video, we discussed Identity as a Service.

### Identity as a Service Challenges
In this video, I'll discuss Identity as a Service challenges. With Identity as a Service, we're outsourcing our identities, whether they be for users, devices, or services. This means that we've got sensitive data that really is under the control of somebody else. We need to implement policies and procedures then to authenticate users correctly through our Identity as a Service. This will ensure that the identities that get transmitted correspond to those that we want for a particular service. We might also configure multifactor authentication for additional security. For example, instead of just knowledge of a username and password, we might also require users to have a PKI certificate installed on their device. Identity as a Service can authorize access to legacy on-premises applications as well as to cloud-based applications. So even though we are outsourcing our identities, it doesn't mean that they can solely be used there. We can also use it to authorize access to internal applications. We also need to consider compatibility with other services. Using SCIM, we have a standard way to provision users, for access control so to grant permissions to resources with group membership.

We can add additional attributes once users get authenticated so we would build up claim values, such as including things like date of birth, or group membership, anything that's required to be consumed by a specific application. Of course, SCIM also allows for user de-provisioning. The great thing about this is it uses standard protocols instead of multiple unique vendor APIs and remember, with Identity as a Service, we've got centralized identity management so instead of de-provisioning users on multiple web application servers, we would do it once centrally. There are also some security challenges that we need to consider, such as ensuring that the identity information of internal users is kept secure. Otherwise, Identity as a Service providers are a large potential target for hackers. We should also think about the secured transmission over the network of user credentials or tokens.

Now we might look at solutions related to digital signatures and, of course, encryption or transmitting data through a secured VPN tunnel site-to-site. We should also think about the secure replication of user credentials. If we've got Identity as a Service, that data for user identities might be replicated between data centers or we might replicate it with our on-premises user store, in which case, we want to make sure that the replication itself is secured, perhaps through a VPN tunnel once again we're using HTTPS. HTTPS should also be used for the administrative interface to our Identity as a Service provider web page, where we provision and work with user accounts. There might also be firewall rules that need to be adjusted to allow administrative access to make changes to our Identity as a Service over the Internet. In this video, we identified challenges related to Identity as a Service.

### Integrating IDaaS and Other Service Models
In this video, I'll talk about integrating Identity as a Service with other service models. In the cloud, we've got Software as a Service, or SaaS, and often, this turns out to be software that people can access from anywhere given a network connection using any device. A good example of SaaS would be Office productivity tools like a spreadsheet or a word processor. Well, instead of configuring identities within each of those offerings, we could do it centrally with Identity as a Service. But we have to consider integrating our centralized Identity as a Service configuration with things like SaaS. We would need to ensure, for example, that internal users, external users, and consumer identities are properly managed in accordance with making it work with our Software as a Service offerings. So we would identify attributes and claims that might be required by those Software as a Service applications. A claim is an assertion or statement about a user, a device, or a service. For example, it could include things like date of birth, group membership, security clearance levels, and so on. This is important because we would need to know if our Software as a Service applications consume claims and if so, we've got to configure our identity provider so it creates these claims.

We also need to think about authentication requirements for specific applications. So an application in the cloud that hosts very sensitive data might have more stringent security requirements. It might require perhaps not just username and password authentication, but in addition, it might require a PKI certificate or a smartcard. We also have to make sure that we adhere to industry standards and regulations if we integrate our identities with Software as a Service. That might require, for example, that anything related to identities been transmitted are encrypted perhaps using an HTTPS type of connection. We've also got Platform as a Service, or PaaS, where at the hosting-provider level they make available things like virtual machines, databases, programming environments for developers. So we need to think about the interaction between our Identity as a Service and developed applications. We have to think about how user accounts get provisioned and de-provisioned. Now we want to make sure that that does not happen within each developed application. That completely defeats the point. With Identity as a Service, we want a centralized identity provider that all of our developed applications will trust and use.

We also have to consider that some applications will need user information stored by our Identity as a Service provider. Web services that developers might build could also be coded to consume claims. And if that's the case, besides authenticating users, our identity service would also have to retrieve those claim attributes and then perhaps even digitally sign or encrypt them to send them securely to the application. With Infrastructure as a Service, we're talking about using host provided items such as virtual machines, storage, virtual networks, firewalls, and so on. Well, we can also integrate our centralized identities with Identity as a Service with Infrastructure as a Service models. So for example, virtual machine images would have associated metadata that can describe attributes relating to the user who created or owns that image. This might be used, for example, to make sure we control which users have access to specific virtual machines or perhaps even how many they can create if there are quotas that are configured.
Heading: Integrating IDaaS and Other Service Models.

IDaas provided data must be transmitted securely.

Both user and image identities need to be verified before virtual machines are deployed and in some cases even before they are launched. So using a centralized Identity as a Service configuration allows us using standard protocols to integrate it with other cloud offerings. In this video, I discussed integrating Identity as a Service with other service models.

### IDaaS Pros and Cons
In this video, I'll talk about Identity as a Service pros and cons. With Identity as a Service, we are outsourcing user identities to a provider. This means that we've got sensitive data hosted elsewhere. So it's important that we evaluate multiple cloud providers to find the best fit. Some things we might consider are application compatibility. We want to make sure that our centralized identities will be able to access or be authorized to use other cloud services even among different cloud providers or even authorized to use on-premises applications that we might still run. We want to take a look at standard protocols like SCIM, which is used for standardized user provisioning management and de-provisioning. We don't want to have to deal with a different way to work with users across a larger system; we want one standardized way centralized. We should also consider secure identity management and use. Connecting to an interface in the cloud to manage user identities needs to be secured so we might do that over an HTTPS connection, and we might use multifactor authentication. We might even configure our user accounts themselves to use multifactor authentication.

One advantage of Identity as a Service is that we're delegating authentication requests to the Identity as a Service provider. This means it makes it simpler for an organization to use cloud service providers that adhere to different federation standards. It's all done through the cloud provider not coming onto our on-premises network. Another advantage is we can use existing identity architectures. So when an organization chooses to adopt Identity as a Service, even the organization's on-premises identity directory can be synchronized with the cloud service provider's identity service directory. It doesn't have to be. We could completely and entirely have all of our identities stored solely in the cloud, but it's important to know that we can also synchronize it locally with our local identity store. Some disadvantages to Identity as a Service include the fact that we are relinquishing some control to a third party. When we think about cloud providers, we can never really guarantee exactly where the data is and that infrastructure is being controlled and managed by the cloud provider staff.

We also have to consider the fact that an organization would need to formulate a governance process with its service provider to make sure that user identities are managed in a proper fashion. This might be something that requires a changing of organizational policies. It might also be something that is stipulated in some way in the Service Level Agreement, the contractual document between the cloud provider and the cloud customer. We should also think about internal compliance requirement reports on-premises. We might want to audit user identity management as well as use, whether it's stored locally on-premises, or in the cloud, or both. In this video, we discussed Identity as a Service pros and cons.

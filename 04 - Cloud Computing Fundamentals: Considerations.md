### Evaluating Cloud Security
[Video description begins] Topic title: Evaluating Cloud Security. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
When it comes to evaluating cloud security, it's definitely important to consider the security of your data when evaluating a cloud computing solution, and effectively what it comes down to is the fact that the data is stored off-site in the cloud infrastructure. So it's no longer directly under your own control and really you don't even know where it is because most cloud providers do not divulge the location of their datacenters. Now they do that for the purposes of security so that they don't become an easier target, but at the end of the day, your data is not on your premises. So that can be a hurdle for a lot of organizations. And it might again come down to legal compliance or regulatory rules, or governmental regulations, whatever, that simply say you cannot store this data outside of your organization. So in some cases, it might actually prevent you from going with a cloud service.

So you know, it always comes down to the fact that the data simply may be more vulnerable under third-party control. Now you know, as the title of the slide here suggests, evaluating the security, you have to also evaluate your own security. It is entirely possible that the data is more secure under the third-party control. You know, maybe your own security is not as high as theirs, and do recall that these are very robust companies usually that provide these services. So they do invest an awful lot into their own security. So they can offer various solutions, including encryption, password authentication, and basic identity management to help ensure that only the appropriate people are able to gain access to this information. But by the same token, when it comes to somebody who is wanting to compromise data, physical access is usually step one. So with the data being outside of your organization, somebody else has the physical access to the equipment. So it is always something that you need to evaluate.

Now as far as the cloud providers themselves, as mentioned, you know, these are very large organizations usually with very high budgets. So they continually strive to improve the data security. There is data regulatory compliance that needs to be taken into account. There is, of course, handling of sensitive data for their customers. And obviously, you know, if they want to continue to provide services in a reliable fashion, if it starts to get around that they are compromising their customer's data, it's not going to take very long, of course, for them to lose their business. So typically, they aim to ensure that the user's data is as or even more secure in the cloud than their own on-site systems. So you know, again it always comes down to what you feel is going to suit your needs, but it is something to evaluate. The data is no longer under your control. But at the same time, the security measures that are in place by these very high-budget, very large organizations may be significantly higher than your own. So you also have to weigh those two out and, you know, determine which one will suit your needs the best.

### Evaluating Cloud Services
[Video description begins] Topic title: Evaluating Cloud Services. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
When it comes to cloud service evaluation, there are a number of factors to consider when determining the best option for the cloud service model that you might want to implement. And of course, one of the main things is network connectivity. Your cloud service provider is accessed, of course, over the Internet. So everything that you are going to implement in a cloud is hosted over the Internet. So you need to determine, is your own Internet connectivity fast enough, stable enough, reliable enough to support that? And certainly consider the flexibility that the offerings might provide for your business. Obviously, the Internet and cloud service providers operate 24x7x365. Your own organization may not, but that might increase the flexibility. Maybe some of your users might like that option. So is that something that's going to be beneficial for your organization?

Scalability in terms of the capacity with respect to the provider, it is easily expandable on that provider's infrastructure. From the perspective of us as a customer, you know, for all intents and purposes, it's unlimited. I can just keep adding and adding and adding whatever I need, whenever I need. Now obviously, your subscription fee will increase accordingly. But if you were to implement those additional resources in your own organization, you would have to pay for those as well. So the scalability is usually a lot more robust in a cloud type of environment. The speed of implementation, when you're dealing with cloud services, things like virtual machines and storage can be implemented, for all intents and purposes, immediately. So the time savings along with that, of course, definitely needs to be considered.

Greenness, a lot of organizations these days are trying to lower their carbon footprint and things like that. So the shared resource model equates to reductions in power consumption. So you may increase your greenness by moving to a cloud model. But control certainly needs to be considered. There is less direct control over your own data and services than in traditional computing models. The data simply does not reside on your premises anymore, so you certainly need to consider how that's going to impact or affect your organization. Interoperability, measure the cloud provider ease-of-service interoperability. Is it something that can fairly easily be integrated into our current organization? Or is there going to have to be a lot of fixes, and patches, and things like that, workarounds to get it to interoperate?

And finally compliance, this is certainly something that needs to be considered, the importance of regulatory compliance requirements with security and privacy of personal data. Now this obviously depends on what you are dealing with and what type of organization you are. But things like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Federal Information Security Management Act, also known as FISMA, are two examples of just basically, you know, regulatory rules and laws that have been implemented, that control how data is stored and managed. So your particular organization may fall under those acts or those laws. So you need to be aware of that and, it might be something as simple as if it's this type of data, it cannot be stored off-site. If that's the case, then you really can't implement any kind of data storage in a cloud service environment, so certainly something to be aware of and definitely something to consider.

### Cloud Service Level Agreements
[Video description begins] Topic title: Cloud Service Level Agreements. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
A component of most cloud subscriptions is what's known as the service level agreement or SLA. And this, as the name indicates, is an agreement between the client and the service provider, which effectively says, "Here's what I need as a client," "Here's what we can provide as the provider," "Do they match up?" So what you'll typically find in an SLA are things like the service scope, the service availability, the customer requirements, and of course, the payment terms. So looking at each of those, the service scope generally defines the expected level of cloud provider technical support, so things like, are you available for support 24x7 or is it just during standard business hours? Am I always able to reach someone on the phone versus having to send an e-mail to a helpdesk? Things like that, so again it's just knowing what we need versus what you provide.

And service availability defines the service uptime expectations. Now ideally a perfect world, every provider would love to say, "We have a 100% uptime," but nothing in this world is a 100%. So they will try to achieve that, but they certainly can't advertise or guarantee it. But you do want to see a number that is quite high, and 99 point something is usually what you'll see. And once you get up into the 99.99, for example, you're generally talking there about a matter of hours per year in downtime. So you know, that's pretty high obviously. But these providers again have all kinds of fault tolerant mechanisms in place in a redundant hardware so that if something does fail, something else is available to assume the services. So the uptime is usually pretty high. But as mentioned, you know, they usually can't guarantee a 100%, but you do want to see a value that's as high as possible.

As for the customer requirements, you know, this might be negotiated and defined based on the type of organizations. So you know, are you a private company or maybe are you a governmental agency? That may determine what kind of requirements are in place. So you know, security laws, privacy rules, things like that in terms of how data is accessed and stored, that can certainly determine what kind of subscription you need and/or possibly whether or not you can even go with a cloud provider. Payment terms obviously defines the payment frequency, and the fee, and whether or not the IT service usage is measured. This is also referred to as metering, so you can find out, well, how much are we actually using. And typically, customers want to see that because almost all cloud providers charge their fees based on usage. So you would then want to see a report that says, "We used this much, therefore our bill is that much." So that's something that you would definitely want to negotiate as part of your service level agreement.

### Business and Consumer Cloud Services
[Video description begins] Topic title: Business and Consumer Cloud Services. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
Cloud services aren't just the domain of businesses and large organizations. Cloud computing impacts all of us, consumers and businesses, but certainly in a bit of a different fashion. But even as a regular consumer, most of us these days are fairly familiar with personal storage and computing requirements that are, in fact, available through cloud providers, in a lot of cases through things like our mobile devices. So if we want to, let's say for example, back up our mobile device, in a lot of cases, we can do so with the provider of that device. So we can store documents, photographs, videos, audio files, whatever they might be in a cloud type of environment rather than having them stored on our own personal computer or just on the device itself. And of course, social networking, again most of us are very familiar with social networking sites these days. So any pictures or documents that we post to those sites are also taking advantage of cloud services.

Now from the business perspective, various types of businesses make use of cloud computing as well, and it ranges from the self-employed individual all the way up to the very large enterprise environment and everything in between. So the startups, the small and the medium-sized businesses, any or all of them can absolutely take advantage of cloud services because it is effectively that pay-as-you-go approach. So you don't have to start with just a minimum fee that might be unaffordable. You simply pay for what you use. So it's attractive to all sizes of business. So it can be quite affordable, which is, of course, very attractive to startups and small businesses. A lot of them simply don't have the means to purchase the physical hardware to set up a new network and have servers, and clients, and routing equipment, and all of that. So going with a cloud-based solution, that infrastructure is already there and we can simply take advantage of that.

It might also mean an easier transition, particularly for a small business to the cloud because they typically don't have legacy data that refers to applications and/or data that has been in use for a very long time. And there are generally fewer business processes and applications that would need to migrate in a small business environment. So it'd be very simple for them to move to a cloud type of environment. But personal data security and privacy, typically this is paramount to some large businesses. There are often strict corporate regulations that deal with storage of data, and in some cases, it may be required that on-site data storage is implemented. Sometimes privacy laws and things like that simply dictate that you cannot store the data off-site. So that might prevent you from going with a cloud service entirely, but for some large businesses, personal data security and privacy is a minimal concern. So if that's the case, cloud computing can improve the time to market for their products and services because again most cloud environments are able to allocate new resources literally within minutes. So that immediacy can definitely help improve the overall time to market for any kind of solution or product.

So you know, it's like anything, you always have to evaluate it to determine whether or not it will suit your needs. But those are certainly things to consider, and certainly do not shy away from cloud services just because you are a smaller organization or even just a self-employed individual. Since it is pay-as-you-go, in a lot of cases, it does represent a very affordable solution.

### Cloud Compliance and Regulatory Issues
[Video description begins] Topic title: Cloud Compliance and Regulatory Issues. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
Depending on the type of business or organization that you are with, this may dictate the importance of various regulatory compliance. In other words, there are a number of rules and laws in place with respect to how data might be stored and how it's retained, particularly when dealing with things like personal information, the data or the network traffic isolation levels that are required, the accessibility of data, and the appropriate levels of access because what it comes down to is that the data that you're dealing with, when you have a cloud solution, is not stored on your premises. It is out of your control in that regard. So you need to be aware of whether or not any of these regulatory issues are applicable to your organization. And one example of that is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, wherein there simply are a number of laws in place that determine whether or not you are actually able to store personal information outside of your own control atleast with respect to the physical location of the data.

So along with this, cloud providers generally won't identify where the data resides. Now of course, that is not to make it more difficult for you to access it. Obviously, they want you to be able to access it but rather so that the physical location is not divulged to somebody who might be attacking that data. So they simply don't divulge the location to try to improve their own security. So you're going to want to verify the data location restrictions with the provider. In other words, you want to know if in fact they do divulge their location, and typically in fact you don't want them to. So along with that, of course, you need to ensure that only authorized individuals on the provider side will have access to the data and only if necessary and, of course, that they're only accessing what they need to. So the principle of least privilege, only what you need when you need it and nothing beyond that. So it's important for the provider to delineate the separation of duties for these administrative functions so that you are simply informed, this is how your data is treated, these are the levels of access by the appropriate people. And you basically just want it spelled out so that you are aware of what's happening with your data because as I mentioned, of course, it is no longer within your physical premises. So you just want to make sure that you are aware of these issues and that they are all addressed appropriately with the provider.

### Barriers to Cloud Adoption
[Video description begins] Topic title: Barriers to Cloud Adoption. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
Cloud computing can definitely offer a number of benefits and be a flexible solution for a lot of organizations. But like anything, it's not always a viable solution for every organization. There are still a number of barriers that remain with respect to adopting cloud solutions. So you definitely need to be aware of these and to consider them in your decision-making process. For starters, business data security and privacy, when you move data to the cloud, it is no longer under your physical control. So you lose that to third-party management, so you need to be aware if that is acceptable for your particular organization. And if you can do it, you need to make sure that you remain in compliance with any kind of laws or regulatory commissions that determine how data must be treated, so things like logging and auditing procedures so that you can verify and maybe see reports as to how your data is being managed. This may allow you to remain in compliance, but you need to be aware if you're even able to store data off-site with some other provider.

A fully-guaranteed, reliable, high-quality services really don't exist. You know, you are relying on the Internet. So there's latency, there's commodity hardware that simply cannot be guaranteed fully reliable and to always provide high-quality services. You really are at the mercy of the performance of the Internet. So it's difficult for them to offer any kind of guarantees in that regard because it's not under their control. It's not under your control. It is simply the Internet itself, so that can be a challenge. The pay-per-use model and add-ons, there might be an extra cost for technical support; disaster recovery; application modifications, or upgrades, or maintenance; and of course, data loss insurance as well. So you need to make sure that you verify what comes with your subscription and what is additional so that you don't get unexpected increases in your fees. And certainly the effort and the overall cost of adopting a new solution, there is going to be time; there is going to be money required to train the users to use this technology, and that might cancel out some of the benefits.

In some cases, the geographical location of the stored data, again varying privacy rules and regulations in different countries might affect the ability to move to a cloud solution. Things like the US Patriot Act ensuring that the information remains within a particular country and accessible only from that country might be in place. So again, you need to be aware as to whether or not the location of the data is going to affect your organization. Then there might also be restricted Internet access due to any kind of geopolitical policies. It simply might not be accessible from particular locations, so you definitely need to be aware of that. And finally, you might be locked into an inflexible contract. Obviously, if you discover that the solution is not meeting your needs, you don't want to have to continue using it for months, possibly years after the fact when you really aren't able to take advantage of it. So again, a number of barriers to consider, but if none of those affect your organization, it certainly can be a beneficial solution.

### Cloud Service Stacks
[Video description begins] Topic title: Cloud Service Stacks. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
The overall approach to describing cloud services implements a layered structure wherein we see this cloud reference model broken down into what's known as service stacks. This conceptualizes the approach into these three separate layers [Video description begins] The Cloud Reference Model is a pyramid with Infrastructure as a Service at the bottom, Platform as a Service in the middle and Software as a Service at the top. The layers are independent of each other. [Video description ends] so that we see a complete picture of a hardware and software stack. Now those of you who have taken any training in networking or maybe application development, I'm sure you're very familiar with the layered approach and this just continues on with that approach. So we see the Software as a Service at the top, Platform as a Service in the center layer, and Infrastructure as a Service at the bottom, and each layer is entirely dependent on the layers below it. But from the perspective of a customer, you don't necessarily have to concern yourself with that, depending on what your needs are and we'll break that down in a moment here.

[Video description begins] A more detailed Cloud Reference Model displays. It contains three layers. IaaS is the bottom layer, PaaS is the middle layer, and SaaS is the top layer. The IaaS layer is further divided into four layers, where Facilities is the bottom layer and the Hardware layer is placed on top of Facilities. The Abstraction and Core connectivity and delivery layers are considered to be a single layer and are placed on top of the Hardware layer. APIs is the top layer. PaaS is the middle layer, which contains the sub layer Integration and middleware. The SaaS layer is further divided into four layers. Date, Metadata, and Content comprises of the bottom layer. On top of this is the Application layer. On top of the Application layer is the APIs layer. The Presentation mobility and Presentation platform are the top layers. [Video description ends]

But looking at the model a little more closely as you move upward, so from the bottom up, each service model inherits the capabilities of the service model below it. So that's kind of what I was referring to when I said the upper layers are dependent on the lower ones. You know, you can't have software at the top layer without hardware at the bottom. You know, it simply can't exist. You have to have some kind of infrastructure to support your application. So they are dependent on the layers below them. But as a customer, that might not actually concern you. So what I'm referring to there is the fact that the stack is organized from the most to the least complex. And each service relates to the next and provides a level of depth not found in the previous layer.

So if we look at SaaS, Software as a Service, you might think, well, that's at the top. Therefore, it's dependent on the other two layers; therefore, it's the most complex. In fact, it's the other way around. When you're dealing with cloud subscriptions, if you are only interested in the top layer Software as a Service, you are leveraging existing applications, and you don't have to concern yourself with the lower layers. You simply subscribe to the applications. The configuration of those services that are required to drive that application don't concern you. For example, maybe it's a customer management application, which requires a database to support it, which requires a server to support the database, which requires a virtual machine to support the server, which requires physical hardware to support the virtual machine. As a customer of just SaaS, you don't need to concern yourself with any of that. So even though it's at the top, it requires all those lower services. From the perspective of a customer, it is the least complex because you only need the software, that's it.

PaaS enables you to design custom applications, so the same thing. We need a development environment, so I have to have virtual machines. I probably have to have databases. I have to have physical servers, of course. So there's more involved when you subscribe to the PaaS layer. So your complexity starts to go up a little bit. And at the very bottom, the IaaS, this in fact is the most complex level of service because you are dealing with the lowest level. So everything you do from that point up involves more complexity. You can implement, of course, all the physical resources and start creating virtual machines. But then you have to concern yourself with, what are we going to do with those virtual machines? Well, let's build a development environment. Okay, well, now you've moved up a layer, let's deploy some of those applications. Okay, well, now you've moved up another layer and you're dealing with the entire stack. Hence that's your highest level of complexity.

So again, it comes down to what you need obviously. But if you can eliminate some of those layers and just focus on, for example, the SaaS layer, then everything else is looked after for you. So again, it's the least complex and might be, you know, a good place to start, if you will, if you're considering a move to a cloud environment because you can test the waters, if you will, see how that works for you. And then if you need some of those lower-level services, you absolutely can implement those as well as you move into a more complex type of solution.

### Infrastructure as a Service
[Video description begins] Topic title: Infrastructure as a Service. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
Infrastructure as a Service, or IaaS, is typically where you'll find the foundational components of any cloud solution. Things like virtual machines, storage accounts, virtual networks, connectivity, these are the types of components that you'll find at the IaaS level. So it's typically not anything that end users are concerned with. They're generally only concerned with being able to access applications to do their work. So this is more so targeted at the IT managers or administrators, the ones who need to determine this is what we have to have in place to have an effective cloud solution. Now anything that's defined at this level is typically available to any device on the network. So again, it's a little lower level, if you will. We're just concerned with connectivity and things like that as opposed to the configuration of an application. That really doesn't happen at this layer.

But at this layer, this is where you can do things, such as rapidly provisioning new compute resources. So for example, if you determine you need more virtual machines to create new database servers or messaging servers, you can very easily and very rapidly do so at the IaaS level. Now similarly, you can rapidly deprovision resources as well. Maybe you're just doing some testing and you needed some temporary servers. Now that the testing is finished, you can simply remove those just as easily as you created them. So it's very fast, very easy to create this foundation of your environment.

The computing infrastructure that you're looking to implement with cloud services is no longer required locally, and that's the whole idea behind using a cloud subscription. Your organization may not have the necessary infrastructure to implement these servers or virtual machines. So you simply take advantage of someone else's. This translates into less local square footage for the IT resources in your own organization because, of course, the hardware simply does not reside there. And along with that, you have less local energy consumption because, of course, the virtual machines are running on physical hardware in somebody else's organization. So they are, of course, using the power or supplying the power, I should say, for those physical resources. So locally your own energy consumption goes down. And basically, again you simply rely on the provider to handle all of that for you.

### Platform as a Service
[Video description begins] Topic title: Platform as a Service. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
In the Platform as a Service layer, we typically find still the same kind of connectivity that you might see at the infrastructure layer. But what we're more so concerned with in the Platform as a Service layer is the ability to rapidly provision new applications and/or required resources. So it's not always so much concerned with virtual machines, or virtual networks, or storage accounts. Those things are still required ultimately, but we're more so concerned with the ability to develop and provision applications at the Platform as a Service layer. You can similarly, very rapidly deprovision any kind of application as well. And again, this is very useful at the testing stage. You can just simply implement this application, test it out, and then deprovision it maybe for its next release, or next update, or next version, or anything along those lines. So with this, the infrastructure in terms of the servers is simply not required locally. You take advantage of the provider's server infrastructure, but you still create your own development environment on that infrastructure.

So this gives you a faster time to market because, of course, you don't have to physically acquire all of that hardware, set it up, configure it, and of course you know, spend all the time doing that just to create your development environment. You can have it literally provisioned within minutes in a cloud-type environment, hence the faster time to market for the ultimate application. Available on demand, so again any kind of provider always offers the ability for you to configure this yourself whenever you want it. So it doesn't really matter when you're working or when you need it. Cloud service providers are 24x7x365 and almost all of them offer self-service configuration, wherein you just put together whatever you need. So this eliminates waste of time due to IT acquisition as well and simplifies the process of creating, testing, and updating the applications because the entire development environment can be put together literally within minutes, maybe a few hours depending, of course, on the complexity, but the overall implementation is greatly simplified. And you can start building and testing your applications literally right away as soon as those resources have been provisioned.

### Software as a Service
[Video description begins] Topic title: Software as a Service. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
The Software as a Service layer is more so the domain of the end user. And this is where we can certainly very easily and quickly provision new users and similarly deprovision them again if they were only, let's say, test accounts. But it's more so wanting those users to be able to sign in and be identified so that they can access an application to perform their job. For example, if it's a customer management software, they do still need to sign in to the cloud service and be identified so that they can access that application. But you can very quickly and easily provision new users anytime you want, as many as you need. And again, they can be deprovisioned in the event that they were just test accounts or, of course, if the person leaves the organization. But at this layer, it's still available to any device on the network. There are no real restrictions there, but of course, the server infrastructure required to implement this particular application, whatever it is, is not required locally. So those lower layers simply aren't necessary from your perspective as a customer. They have to be there, but it's managed by the provider.

And along with that, the application licensing, the monitoring, and the management of your application is also all done by the provider. So I don't even have to concern myself with purchasing it, configuring it, deploying it, licensing it, monitoring it, updating it. All of that goes away; it is all done by the provider. You still pay your subscription fee, of course. And the more you use it, the more you'll pay, but you just don't have to worry about any of that. It is up to the provider to handle it. So it's a very attractive feature for environments that want to very quickly access, and provision, and deploy a new application without having to worry about any of that. You don't need the servers. You don't need the deployment software. You don't need the licensing. You don't have to deal with it at all. You simply create your users in the Software as a Service layer. You allow them to access the application, and that's it, you're done. That user can now access that application.

### Costing the Cloud
[Video description begins] Topic title: Costing the Cloud. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
A move toward cloud-based services certainly requires a lot of planning and a number of considerations and perhaps one of those foremost considerations is, of course, the cost. So we're going to look at cost in the cloud here from two different expense point of views, one known as CAPEX or Capital Expense and the other known as OPEX or Operational Expense. Now for all cloud-based services, they are based on a pay-as-you-go model. So with that, your resource usage is metered so you only pay for what you use. But with that, you can have a couple of different types of usage, if you will. You can see what's known as a chargeback or departmental billing if you have a private cloud wherein you are, in essence, implementing cloud services within your own organization. So one of your departments is subscribing to the cloud services may be call them Headquarters, if you will, and then you can just implement these chargebacks per department.

Now if it's a public cloud, then, of course, the Internet consumer is billed. But in either case, the consumer does not incur any IT capital expenditures. In other words, you really don't have to implement any kind of infrastructure to subscribe to cloud-based services. The infrastructure belongs to the provider and is already there. So you see an immediate decrease in the capital expenses that your organization might require. So if we look at a traditional internal IT infrastructure without cloud services whatsoever, all aspects of the infrastructure are acquired, set up, and managed internally. So in other words, you have a very high CAPEX. You have a lot of capital expenses.

If you have, may be, a collocation facility, then this is owned by a third-party that rents the space equipped for housing and running the IT infrastructure. They may also provide network connectivity, backup power, and physical security services. So in other words, the third-party that owns the facility is already providing some of the infrastructure for you. This might still have a high CAPEX, but not as high as acquiring everything yourself. So we have now still a fairly high CAPEX, but moderate OPEX because you are paying probably to a certain degree for some of that space and equipment that is already present. Now if you look at a managed service type of environment, then we have a full outsourcing of an IT infrastructure. So you might still have your physical location and things like that. The provider is responsible for the management of hardware, basic software systems, software rental and maybe database management things like that. So this further reduces the CAPEX and increases the OPEX.

So then if we finally look at the entire public cloud, then we have a fully outsourced infrastructure solution. Hosted virtual computing environment, this effectively removes CAPEX. It involves only OPEX. Now this is going to vary, of course, based on the leverage service. But in essence, you are subscribing to the entire IT infrastructure of someone else. So with that, there really aren't any capital expenses. So with that, cloud computing is generally, fairly cost effective. The actual cost of your implementation is certainly going to depend on your business requirements. But some of those considerations if we, sort of, put it all together, we have ongoing operational costs, but we are reducing the capital expenses. The ability to upsize or downsize on-demand is much greater with cloud services. But there is a shifting risk, you know, moving from a completely internal organization to the cloud does involve fair number of processes and time so there's some risk there, but we also get a reuse of services that's very flexible. The overall environment becomes very agile. So there are always things that you need to weigh out, the pros and cons, you know, for any kind of any kind of move.

But in terms of cost effectiveness, you do generally result in a much lowered CAPEX, but maybe a bit of a higher OPEX. But like anything, you do have to just wear out those costs. Now do consider, of course, with a very high CAPEX, you also have assets. Wherein, if it's only OPEX, for example, then you have very few assets so that's something that is also part of the equation, so a lot of things to consider. But typically, a move toward a cloud type of environment is very cost effective because of eliminating those capital expenses.

### Cloud Deployment Models
[Video description begins] Topic title: Cloud Deployment Models. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
There are a few different cloud deployment models available and we're going to take a look at them here. But as far as the standard Internet-based consumer is concerned, the public cloud is probably what they are most familiar with. And with a public cloud, your IT services are available to any subscriber on the Internet. Those services are hosted entirely on the provider equipment and they're available 24/7, 365 days a year. It's easy and inexpensive for the consumers. They don't have to start from scratch. They can reuse their own existing data and/or their application configurations. It's very scalable and very rapidly scalable. The data resides in a data center and those data centers can replicate the data. Continuing on, the provider is responsible for making all of the capital investments in the infrastructure. In other words, the physical equipment that's required is all paid for entirely by the provider. You don't need anything. So consumers treat the public cloud entirely as an operational expense in terms of the expenditures. You don't have to acquire any new equipment.

So there's reduced local space as well as reduced local energy consumption, and less local IT expertise is generally required. The responsibility for all of the IT service, maintenance, upgrades, all of that falls on the provider with a public cloud. Now the next implementation is what's known as a private cloud. And with this, IT services are hosted on equipment owned by a private organization. Services are still delivered over a network, but they're only available to users within the organization. So typically, what you'll see here is may be a fairly large environment that has multiple different departments. And let's call the parent company headquarters, if you will, then each department or division will subscribe to the IT services of headquarters. So it's still cloud-based, you're still subscribing to someone else's services, but it all falls under the same corporate umbrella, if you will.

So the organization is still responsible for the hardware, the software, the licenses, the installation, configuration, patching, troubleshooting, all of that maintenance still falls under that organization, but it's each division or department then...that does not have to worry about that. It would only be headquarters. So continue on with private cloud you still have full control over things like data, regulatory compliance, and fault tolerance. So sometimes depending on the organization, you cannot go with a public cloud because you aren't allowed to store data outside of your control. With a private cloud implementation, you still maintain that control. So again, it's just the individual divisions or departments that don't have that control, but still within the same organization. Now you can combine them, if you will. You can have a hybrid cloud, which combines public and private. The consumer integrates their on-premise IT services with a cloud provider. And maybe this is something that might be used as an interim solution before moving entirely to a public cloud. But, of course, that's up to you. You absolutely can maintain both at the same time for as long as it suits your needs.

Then the final approach is what's known as the community cloud and there's pools computing resources to serve organizations with common needs. This might help with things like regulatory compliance, still gives you fast access to an application and/or data and, maybe, suits the needs of organizations that have similar security requirements. So it's, kind of, like a combination still of private and public. Maybe, it is a partnership of organizations that have these similar requirements and they're just trying to save on the overall IT infrastructure cost by implementing some type of cloud-based service from a provider that can dedicate their resources to that partnership of organizations. That's not as common, but still something that you might find out there. Now whichever cloud deployment model you feel is best going to suit your needs, obviously is up to you and depends on the organization but those are some of the approaches you might find when you are evaluating some of the different types of cloud-based solutions.

### Cloud Costing Models
[Video description begins] Topic title: Cloud Costing Models. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
The cost of any IT service implementation is always going to be something that's of paramount importance. So in weighing a cloud model adoption, in addition to the initial outlay costs, it's important to consider the following. Your ongoing operational costs when compared to the reduction in capital expenses. Now with cloud-based services, they are typically much more heavy on the operational expense, but at the same time, you are, of course, reducing the capital. So it's always a matter of how those two balance out. Now with the ongoing operational cost, the cost can be more than your monthly subscription fee. Things like additional bandwidth, and compliance, and maintenance, and things like that may increase the amount that you pay per month. So it's not just the subscription, it is, of course, the usage over and above that. But at the same time, as mentioned, you are reducing your capital expenses. You are leveraging unowned cloud technology that is probably unaffordable to purchase outright, at least for maybe a smaller to medium-sized business or particularly a startup.

It's usually pretty difficult for a startup to be able to gain access to those kinds of funds to outright purchase all of that equipment. So this makes it much easier for those startups and small to medium-sized businesses to implement a very cost-effective IT solution. But with respect to the models, there are effectively three types and the first one is, in fact, actually free. Now this entirely depends on the type of organization you are. This is usually something that is available to someone who is a marketing type of company, wherein they are able to register and use the service for free. But what they're doing is allowing the provider to advertise or remarket their product. Now they might also be looking at collecting usage metrics that might be tracked and sold. So they can simply provide this information back to those who are subscribing to the cloud services, so that they have a very good idea as to what kind of metering and usage is happening with respect to their subscription. So again, this is something that you might only find with a marketing or advertising type of organization.

The other types of models are a plan payment model, wherein the consumer does commit to an anticipated usage. Now this helps to keep the amount consistent, so you have a bill that's the same every month. That typically makes it easier for billing, and accounting, and things like that, but you're billed at a premium for any usage over your plan. So you might still get unexpected peaks in the bill because you exceeded what the plan determines. So it is used for a pattern of regular use of IT resources, but you do need to be aware of those possible spikes if you go above it. And then finally, the last one is a pay as you go payment model and this is typically what you'll find in most cloud subscriptions. There is a small monthly subscription fee that you pay no matter what. Even if you use nothing, you would still have that fee. But from that point, your usage is metered and you pay for whatever you use, over and above the subscription fee.

Now you can place a limit if you want to, in a lot of cases, so that you can avoid these large bills. So you simply implement a cap or a ceiling, if you will, that says if we exceed this, the service needs to be shut down. Now again, obviously, you need to be aware of whether or not that is acceptable. Obviously, you know, if it was something like a web site, for example, you don't want that getting shut down, so we need to make sure that there's something that is acceptable to be capped or limited. But those are the different types of payment models that you might encounter and obviously, you need to try to determine which one will best suit your needs.

### Assessing Applications for the Cloud
[Video description begins] Topic title: Assessing Applications for the Cloud. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
Cloud computing can certainly provide a number of benefits. But when considering a move to the cloud, you'll also have to consider your applications. And certain applications, like anything, are better suited to cloud computing than others. So you want to consider applications that are required maybe only for a limited period, maybe your organization is going through a developmental phase that is only going to be temporary and you require some kind of software application to support that phase. Well, a cloud implementation of that application might be much more cost effective than purchasing and licensing that software, and then dealing with the distribution, the deployment, and the configuration, and the upgrades, and the maintenance, and all of that. So definitely, you might want to look at a cloud-based solution there or any application that needs to be scaled often or that might have variable loads. This is a good candidate because it's so fast and easy to scale in a cloud environment and then to distribute that load because new virtual machines, for example, can be provisioned within minutes.

At the end of the day, you are still relying on your Internet connectivity when accessing the cloud services. So an application that is non-critical is a little better suited to the cloud because if you do lose your Internet, you, of course, lose access to the cloud and hence that application. So public cloud models are definitely a great solution for startup companies, particularly because of that minimal initial capital outlay and the scalability that's offered. You know, a lot of startups just cannot come up with the funds necessary to outright purchase an IT infrastructure. So with cloud services, the infrastructure is already there. You simply subscribe to it and there's your IT solution. Not only is that a better option in terms of cost, but it is very fast and very flexible. So this agility enables a quicker time to market for new products because you just don't have to spend the time or the money to implement your infrastructure.

Now it may not be the ideal solution with things like legacy systems, mission-critical applications, or applications that handle sensitive data. So with the legacy, there might be an increased cost in dealing with any kind of outdated technologies or proprietary hardware and software that's required to drive them. They may not be compatible with the cloud platform, so that's always something to consider. And again, for mission-critical applications, it might not be suitable for a cloud type of adoption here because again you are relying on the Internet. So real-time connectivity for these mission-critical applications may be required and if your Internet goes down, well, you lose connectivity to that application. So that could be disastrous. And applications handling the sensitive data, there is an increased risk with transferring or storing highly confidential or sensitive information in the cloud because, again, it is no longer under your physical control. So you always need to be aware of that. Those are some of the limitations and considerations in terms of assessing your application compatibility for a cloud type of environment.

### Exercise: Choosing a Cloud Service
[Video description begins] Topic title: Exercise: Choosing a Cloud Service. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
For this exercise, we're going to ask you to consider the following IT services and try to identify and describe some considerations in moving them to a public cloud service. So we have corporate e-mail, file servers and file sharing, and a line-of-business order processing application. So what we'd like you to do is to pause the video and perform the exercise and, again just try to document out some of the considerations. And then we'll come back and compare what you have to some considerations that we have listed here and see how they match up. So we'll see you in a few minutes.

Okay, so as far as some of the concerns that you might want to consider. For starters, we have cost implications. The cost shift from CAPEX to OPEX and that's Capital Expenditures to Operational Expenditures. There could be a significant change because, of course, you don't have to have the infrastructure in place to support those services if you move them to a cloud. So for services used sporadically, cost may be significantly lower. Things like file sharing if that's not something that's overly used internally, then you no longer need the physical infrastructure to support it. So you might have a significant reduction in cost. You could potentially remove all on-premise servers and support staff, but you certainly would still require some staff with cloud skills. So you do have to weigh them out of course, but there could be a significant change in the cost implications. Ubiquity implications, applications that were previously only available in the office are now available from anywhere. And that's effectively what ubiquitous means, of course, is that it's all over the place, doesn't matter where you are, you have access to that application. So e-mail and file sharing, this could certainly be a positive. It enables work from anywhere.

The line-of-business application possibly could have negative connotations because now you have to concern yourself with privacy of customer data and potential data breach. So it's not always a good thing that any given application is always available from anywhere. So you do have to consider the positives and the negatives as well. Availability implications, applications now require functioning Internet connections to be supported. So for something like e-mail no change except internal e-mail fails now with Internet. So you know, obviously, if I'm going to send you an e-mail and we're in different organizations and you lose Internet, that's no different. Internet fails, the e-mail is not going to reach your organization. But with e-mail hosted internally, at least you can still send internal e-mail. You do not need the Internet for that. So if you move your e-mail entirely to the cloud, then even your internal e-mail will fail if the Internet fails so you would certainly need to consider that. File sharing and line-of-business application, again same problem. Failed Internet connection prevents access to the application. So even internally, you would not have access to your application or your file share. So again, always consider the negative as well.

Elasticity implications for file sharing and e-mail, likely to be a relatively predictable load. You know, e-mail is fairly consistent most of the time unless you do something like a huge corporate acquisition and all the sudden need 5000 more mailboxes. But you know, variability may come with things like project dates. If you have a deadline, for example, a lot of additional e-mails tend to start flying around, so that can increase your costs along with, you know, having to possibly increase the resources of your e-mail server. So your costs may go up with that. And as far as the line-of-business application goes, loads may vary with the business dependent on what that is. And there could be seasonal businesses that are more highly variable. You know, for example, if it's a shopping site, Christmas season, and summer vacation, and things like that tend to result in an increase. And rapid growth would also require elasticity. But those would be things that would be easily accommodated by the cloud because your scalability and flexibility is very easily accommodated in a cloud type of solution. And as far then as legacy app implications go, older applications as for the line-of-business application, it may be intolerant to variable networks such as minor outages and/or latency. So it certainly depends on how old the application is and whether or not it's flexible enough to these changes and may require some proprietary or legacy hardware and/or software. So that may not make it a good candidate for a cloud service.

And finally, e-mail and file sharing with respect to legacy implications; it may require a radical change to your infrastructure. So it might be a candidate for Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, or even Software as a Service. But you know, you always have to consider whether or not your existing application is going to be too costly to change. So all of those are considerations, again, both positive and negative. And like anything, in this regard, there's no single correct answer, but rather just try to identify what concerns you may be dealing with.

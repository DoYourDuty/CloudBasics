### Information Security Objectives
In this video, I'll discuss information security objectives. The cloud security alliance, or CSA, is concerned with providing security guidance in cloud computing environments. CSA consists of governments, industry practitioners, corporate and private members, and so on. Collectively, these members offer cloud security recommendations, education, and certification. And we've got to remember that when we deploy cloud IT services and data, we're placing a lot of trust in a third party. So there are inherent security risks in doing this. What we're talking about here then is security controls that are put in place so that those risks are mitigated or at least are manageable. When we secure cloud assets, we need to think about data as well as applications. On the data side, we need to think about the integrity or trustworthiness of that data, authentication to systems that lead to access to the data. That also includes physical access where the data is stored on compute infrastructure. We also need to make sure that data is available whenever it's needed. So if there's a failure of some kind, we have to have a contingency plan in place. Let's examine each of those in a bit more detail starting with data integrity.
Heading: Information Security Objectives.

An organization's security posture is characterized by the maturity, effectiveness, and completeness of the risk-adjusted Security controls implemented. These controls are implemented in one or more layers ranging from the facilities (Physical security), to the network infrastructure (network security), to the IT system (system security), all the way to the Information and applications (application security). Additionally, controls are implemented at the people and process levels, such as separation of duties and change management, respectively.

We need to make sure data hasn't been tampered with and that it's not corrupt either while it's being stored or while in transit. We want to make sure that we have frequent backups that are not corrupt. Data needs to be recoverable in a timely fashion when it's needed. Access to that data needs to be controlled whether it's by permissions to users groups or even through role-based access control. Eventually, data reaches the end of its useful life to a point where it can actually be deleted. In the cloud, we need to ensure that data is deleted in an acceptable way to ensure that other cloud tenants won't be able to gain access to any data remnants that might reside on disk. You also need to make sure that data doesn't get corrupted or stolen. We need to put the correct measures in place. Part of that is access control. It also includes frequent backups. Access to the data needs to be audited. Now that should happen on the cloud provider side, but we might also have control as cloud customers. We might have a web interface where we can configure or view audit captured data. And for data integrity, of course, there needs to be isolation provided between cloud tenants. That might be done at the virtual network level to keep the network traffic of one cloud customer separate from another cloud customer. The same time we want to make sure virtual machines themselves running in the cloud are kept isolated.

On the access and authentication level, we need to make sure that we deploy interdevice trust. So in a secured environment where we have sensitive data being accessed through a cloud app, we might deploy PKI security certificates, which contain public and private key pairs that are unique to the user or device that they were issued to. This way only trusted devices, for example, are allowed to even begin a connection to a cloud app. Secure user identification might include using strong passwords, and frequent password changes, and even multifactor authentication. Security certificates need to be managed properly because they do have an expiry date and once they expire, the public and private keys contained in those certificates are no longer valid. So we want to make sure that certificates are renewed before they expire if the entity to which they were issued is still considered valid and trustworthy. Of course, we need to make sure that audit logs are retained related to access to data and authentication.

We also should ensure that we're using some kind of a centralized identity provider for authentication so that we don't need to account for authentication in each and every cloud-based application. This can be achieved with identity federation. Physical access to the compute infrastructure in a cloud data center needs to be strictly controlled. We want to make sure that even staff in the data center physically doesn't have access to client data that's stored on that cloud infrastructure. This means that there should be thorough background checks performed on any cloud-provider data center employee. And there should be closed circuit TV security in place to monitor the users as well as the equipment at the cloud-provider network. We need to have a plan B, a contingency plan so that data is continuously available whenever we need it. We could deploy failover mechanisms in the cloud or the cloud provider might be doing this as well such as failover clustering where if one node or one server fails that's offering network services, those services are failed over to a remaining node that's still running.
Heading: Information Security Objectives.

There should be efficient recovery of data.

We should also make sure that we have a multi-location topology. For example, if there's a problem with an entire data center maybe due to a flood, ideally, the cloud provider would be replicating that data to other data centers under their control. We should also have an adequate backup schedule both as a cloud customer and in some cases, according to the service-level agreement, the cloud provider might also do this on our behalf. It's important that we look at third-party security assessments on the cloud provider's systems, their processes, and their equipment so that we can determine whether or not they are trustworthy. Should also make sure that we have a smooth transition when we migrate services to the cloud. Ideally, we won't be caught in vendor lock-in. We want to make sure we're using standardized applications or if that's not possible, we at least have the option of exporting data from those applications in a standardized format so that if needed, we can easily migrate that to a different cloud provider.

We also want to make sure that denial of service attacks are prevented against cloud IT services so we could ask the cloud provider about that or we might even be able to configure that with cloud-based firewall solutions. At the application function and service levels, we need to make sure that security vulnerabilities are identified within specific cloud applications that we will be using. Sometimes patches are available to mitigate those issues. There might also be emphasis on Platform as a Service where developers are responsible for security within the application that is hosted on a Software as a Service platform. Now bear in mind that doesn't mean that the developer builds in authentication into each app. What we want is the opposite approach, where they don't do that and instead rely on trusted identity providers through identity federation. In this video, we discussed information security objectives.
Heading: Information Security Objectives.

There should be emphasis on Software as a Service or SaaS platform and its inherent security requirements. This responsibility falls on the SaaS provider.

### Cloud Security Challenges
Outsourcing IT workloads and data to a third-party provider introduces some security risks. Some of which are similar to what we would face even if everything were hosted on-premises. In this video, I'll talk about cloud security challenges. In the cloud, we need to think about what assets are? An asset in the cloud could be something of value to the organization such as database records or files that might contain customer transactions, private information for customers or patients, or it could include trade secrets, and so on. Threats are potential malicious or accidental events that could occur against those assets. A vulnerability is a weakness. That weakness could be in our authentication mechanisms in an applications API or in the way that data is transmitted or stored. An attack is an action taken to exploit vulnerability and activate a threat. We need to think about counter measures that can be put in place to reduce the possibility of those threats being realized.

Security challenges in the cloud include data breaches where there is unauthorized access to data. That could be from customers, from other users within an organization, from the cloud provider's personnel, or even from malicious users on the Internet. Data loss comes in the form of theft, leakage, and data corruption. What we might put in place as a counter measure for data leakage is digital rights management or DRM whereby we strictly control how data can be copied, forwarded through e-mail, printed, and so on. We might also reduce the possibility of losing data due to corruption by conducting frequent backups and verifying that the backups themselves are valid and not corrupted. An authorization challenge comes in the form of accounts that get hacked by malicious users, or credentials, or sensitive data that gets intercepted over the network. Poorly designed interfaces and APIs within software can definitely lead to problems; in terms of confidentiality, integrity, availability, or accountability. Denial of service, or DoS, attacks attempt to render a service unusable for legitimate purposes. This might be done by flooding a network with useless network traffic or by crashing a virtual machine host running a service in the cloud.

There also could be malicious insider activity at the cloud service provider. We need to make sure that thorough background checks and third-party audits are made at the cloud service provider level and that that data is made available to us, the cloud customer. Poor planning always results in security issues. For example, if there's insufficient research during planning cloud deployment and poor due diligence of the cloud service providers certification, then mechanisms and processes in use, they will also suffer. And we have to think about planning for running IT workloads in the cloud, how we're going to authenticate users, how data is going to be backed up. We might also consider migrating services or data from on-premises to the cloud. All of these aspects of cloud computing need to be planned thoroughly ahead of time. Multi-tenancy means that we have multiple customers sharing the same physical infrastructure on the cloud provider network. However, there is isolation used through virtual networks or virtual machines. However, if isolation isn't properly implemented, for example, within virtual machines owned by different cloud tenants, then a security breach within one virtual machine might lead to access to other virtual machines in the cloud providers data center. In this video, we discussed cloud security challenges.

### Cloud Security Models
In this video, I'll discuss cloud security models. Cloud models define security requirements, strategies, and responsibilities in terms of whether the security responsibility falls on the cloud consumer or the cloud provider. The cloud security alliance or CSA defines this issue by outlining the physical location of assets, resources, and information, and by whom they are being consumed, which defines who is responsible for their governance. There are three documented models. The first of which is the Cloud Risk Accumulation Model of the cloud security alliance, then there's the Jericho Forums Cloud Cube Model. Finally, we have the NIST Model, which includes multi-tenancy. With the Cloud Risk Accumulation Model of the cloud security alliance, there needs to be an understanding of the layer dependency with the various cloud service models. This is important when identifying security risks and who is responsible for their control.
Heading: Cloud Security Models.

The CSA Cloud Reference Model is displayed. It includes the following three service models: IaaS, PaaS and SaaS.

The Infrastructure as a Service or IaaS model is the bottom layer. It is also known as the foundation layer, which is used for computing and storage. In this model, the bottom-most layer is the Facilities. On top of the Facilities layer is the Hardware layer. On top of the Hardware layer are the Abstraction and Core connectivity and delivery layers. On top of these layers is the APIs layer.

The Platform as a Service or PaaS model is the middle layer. It is a rapid application model and acts as a middleware to the IaaS. This model contains the Integration and Middleware layers.

The Software as a Service or SaaS is the top layer. It represents the complete applications on top of the PaaS service model. This model includes the Date, Metadata, and Content layers at the bottom of the SaaS model. On top of these layers is the Applications layer. On top of the Applications layer is the APIs layer. The Presentation mobility and Presentation platform are the top-most layers.

So the cloud security alliance then defines this interdependency between the three major service models. The three major service models we're really talking about include Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service. Now with Infrastructure as a Service, we the cloud customer are creating infrastructure on cloud provider equipment so we might be building virtual networks, virtual machines, and configuring cloud storage because we're doing most of the configuring, the security burden then falls on us, the cloud customer. But if we go to the other end of the scale where we look at Software as a Service, most of the security responsibility falls on the cloud provider and this is because we are using an offered IT solution that's already built and made available through that cloud service provider. With on-premises IT solutions, because we completely manage them, we are then completely responsible for their security. But again, if we go all the way to Software as a Service hosted through a cloud provider, they then would be responsible for the vast majority of their offerings at that cloud model level.
Heading: Cloud Security Models.

A graph displaying that the security burden is directly proportional to the deployed models is displayed. This graphic consists of three models, the IaaS model, the IaaS and PaaS model. In this graph, the security is least at the at IaaS or cloud consumer and then at PaaS. The highest security is at SaaS or the cloud provider.

On the left is the IaaS model. In this model, the bottom layer is the Facilities. On top of the Facilities layer is the Hardware later. On top of the Hardware layer are the Abstraction and Core connectivity and delivery layers. On top of this layer is the APIs layer.

Next to the IaaS model, is the PaaS model. This model contains the Integration and Middleware along with the layers in the IaaS model. The Integration and Middleware layers on top of the layers in the IaaS model.

On the right are the SaaS model. The SaaS model is on top of the PaaS model. This model includes the Date, Metadata, and Content layers at the bottom of the SaaS model. On top of these layers is the Applications layer. On top of the Applications layer is the APIs layer. The Presentation mobility and Presentation platform are the top-most layers.

A graphic displaying the areas of responsibility in cloud security is displayed. It contains the following models: On-Premises, IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. All the models include the following layers: Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, O/S, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, and Networking.
In the On-Premises model, all the layers are labeled managed by you.

The IaaS model includes the following layers: Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, O/S, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, and Networking. The following layers are labeled managed by you: Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, and O/S. The following layers are labeled Other manages: Virtualization, Servers, Storage, and Networking.

The PaaS model includes the following layers: Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, O/S, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, and Networking. The following layers are labeled managed by you: Applications and Data. The following layers are labeled Other manages: Runtime, Middleware, O/S, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, and Networking.

The SaaS model includes the following layers: Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, O/S, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, and Networking. In this model, all the layers are labeled managed by you.

The cloud cube model consists of four dimensions of deployment. The first of which defines whether the cloud data is stored internally or externally. We could have data stored on-premises in the cloud or perhaps even both if we're even synchronizing data to keep it up to date between on-premises and the cloud. The second dimension is whether we are using proprietary versus open source cloud solutions. OpenStack is an example of open source cloud software whereas Microsoft Azure is proprietary to Microsoft Corporation. The third dimension is parameterized versus deparameterized architectures. Here we're talking about the cloud security perimeter that is either in our zone, under our control, or in another external zone. Then we've got insourced versus outsourced as another dimension, where outsourced means that the cloud service is provided by a third party. Insource means the cloud service is provided and controlled internally. In other words, a private cloud solution.

With the cloud cube model, the four criteria and dimensions give rise to numerous permutations for cloud deployment. And we need to examine each of them to understand and then develop security requirements, strategies, and responsibilities. So we have to consider whether we've got IT services being outsourced or insourced, whether we're using a proprietary versus an open cloud solution, and so on. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST also outlines cloud deployment models in publication 800-145. Here in publication 800-145, we can see there is a discussion of various deployment models including a private cloud, a community cloud, a public cloud, as well as a hybrid cloud. All of the security issues related to that are also outlined in this publication.
Heading: Cloud Security Models.

The Jericho Forum model from the Cloud Cube Model is displayed. It displays a cube inside a cloud. The x-axis of the cube contains the Proprietary dimension at the left and the Open dimension at the right. The y-axis contains the Internal dimension at the bottom and the External dimension at the top. The z-axis contains the Parameterized dimension and the De- Parameterized dimension. This cube is further divided in eight cubes. The Insourced cube contains the following dimensions: Internal, Proprietary, and Parameterized. The Outsourced cube includes the following dimensions: External, Open and De- Parameterized.

The home page of the csrc.nist.gov web site is displayed in the Google Chrome browser window. The URL of page displayed is:
csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-145/SP800-145.pdf

The home page includes information about deployment models and their definitions. The four different deployment models are as follows: Private cloud, Community cloud, Public cloud, and Hybrid cloud.

In the Private cloud, the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization compromising of multiple consumers, for example, business units. It may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.

In the Community cloud, the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns, for example, mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations. It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.

In the Public cloud, the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization, or some combination of them. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.

In the Hybrid cloud, the cloud infrastructure is a combination of two or more distinct aloud infrastructures like private, community, or public that remains unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability, for example, cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds.

Then there's the issue of multi-tenancy and security. This implies the sharing of resources and applications with multiple users from different companies. You know, that's all happening on a cloud provider's infrastructure. So this implies the requirement for a rigid security policy that guarantees consumer data segregation, isolation, service levels, and governance. So we need to have a defined isolation or security boundaries between different cloud tenants that could be achieved at the network level to keep network traffic isolated between cloud tenants or even at the application instance or virtual machine level to make sure that many customers using the same applications in the cloud have a separate instance to keep the data and the running of that process separated. In this video, we discussed cloud security models.
Heading: Cloud Security Models.

A graphic displaying multi-tenancy in a Virtualized Public Cloud in an Off-Premise Datacenter is displayed.

A Public Cloud Provider with three business customers, A, B, and C are displayed. They have different security, SLA, governance, and billing polices on shared infrastructure.

There are two VMMs. The first VMM contains five VMs and the second VMM contains two VMs. Customer A and Customer B use the first VMM and the Customer C uses the second VMM. Customer A uses three VMs in the first VMM. Customer B uses two VMs on the first VMM. Customer C uses the two VMs in the second VMM.

### Information Security Standards
In this video, I'll discuss information security standards. The ISO web page lists a number of information security management publications where they discuss ISMS, Information Security Management System. Many of the publications are available here for reading as well as articles related to security governance. When we outsource IT workloads and our data to a third-party cloud provider, we're introducing a new element of risk that wasn't there before. As such, it can be very important that we follow information security standards. The ISO/IEC has adopted a lot of their publications so that they relate to cloud services. ISO/IEC 27001:2013 deals with ISMS, Information Security Management System. This is designed to help small, medium, and large businesses in any sector to keep information assets secure.
Heading: Information Security Standards.

The ISO/IEC 27001 – Information security management tabbed page is displayed in the Google Chrome browser window. The address bar of this widow displays the following URL:

www.iso.org/iso/home.standards/management-standards/iso27001.htm

This page includes the login, Members area, and a cart icons at the top-left corner of the page. This page also includes the following tabs: Standards, About us, Standards Development, News, and Store and the Search ISO search field. The Standards tab is selected by default and it contains the following tabs: Benefits, Certification, and Management system standards. The Management system standards tab is displayed by default.

This page is divided into two panes, the left pane and the right pane. The left pane contains information about the ISO/IEC 27001 – Information security management. It contains information for the following sections: What is an ISMS, Preview ISO/IEC 27001:2013, Certification to ISO/IEC 27001, Useful articles, and News. The right pane includes the Online collection: Information Security Management Systems and ISO Store sections.

The presenter now explains the following points on ISMS:

Some of the important ISO Information Security Standards are: ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and ISO/IEC 20001-9:2015 – Part 9, which provides the guidance on the application of ISO/IEC 27001-1 to cloud services in development.

ISO/IEC 27001:2013 specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an information security management system within the context of the organization. It also includes requirements for the assessment and treatment of information security risks tailored to the needs of the organization.

ISO/IEC 27002:2013 is a code of practice for information security controls. So this works well for organizations with intentions of selecting security controls within the process of implementing an ISMS. Also there's the implementation of commonly accepted information security controls. For example, firewalls, antivirus scanners, demilitarized zones, and so on. In some cases, organizations could also develop or customize their own information security management policies. The ISO/IEC documentation are general guidelines, which often need to be tailored to specific organizational needs. ISO 31000:2009 focuses on risk management, and principles, and guidelines. This way we can deal with the risk that is inherently introduced with working, for example, with cloud providers and put security controls in place to mitigate those security issues. In this video, we discussed information security standards.
Heading: Information Security Standards.

The ISO 31000:2009 provides principles and generic guidelines on risk management. It can be used by any public, private or community enterprise, association, group or individual and not industry or sector-specific. It can also be applied throughout the life of an organization and to a wide range of activities including strategies and decisions, operations, processes, functions, projects, products, services, and assets.

### Security as a Service
In this video, I'll discuss Security as a Service. Security as a Service, or SecaaS, is defined as an outsourcing model for security management to a trusted third party. And this would include applications, such as antivirus software, Single Sign-On configurations, e-mail protection, firewalls, and so on. So these services are made available on a cloud provider's infrastructure but delivered over the Internet. SecaaS is defined as a subgrouping underneath Software as a Service. The CSA, the Cloud Security Alliance, defines SecaaS as, "Security as a Service is the delegation of detection, remediation, and governance of security infrastructure to a trusted third party...". Let's take a look at the CSA publication related to this. The Cloud Security Alliance makes their publications available to anybody over the Internet. Here I'm going to search for secaas, and we can see in our PDF document that we have a SecaaS Implementation Guidance where we can get details related to working with this as a service through the cloud.
Heading: Security as a Service.

The presenter navigates to the Google Chrome browser window. It displays a tabbed page with the following URL:

https:downloads.cloudsecurityalliance.org/initiatives/secaas/SecaaS_Cat_3_Web_Security_Implementation_Guidance.pdf

The presenter opens the Find text box and enters secaas. The page finds the first SecaaS, which is the SecaaS Implementation Guidance.

But what are the benefits of using this model? Well, there are a number of benefits to SecaaS. The first is constant and user-independent virus definition updates if that's the service that we're using in the cloud. The second is that there is more advanced security expertise available at the cloud service provider than would probably be available within our organizations or government agencies. There is efficient user provisioning and setup because one of the benefits of cloud-provided services is rapid elasticity, and that is possible also with SecaaS. The logging and administration is the responsibility of the cloud service provider where we would have a browser interface for self-administration and activity monitoring that relate to our Security as a Service offerings. There's also the issue of on-demand cost basis. Essentially, we consume the services as required and pay, generally speaking, only for what we've used.

Some examples of Security as a Service offerings include virus protection, data loss prevention, cryptography, network monitoring, web gateways, log management, e-mail security, intrusion detection, and so on. So instead of us hosting this on-premises, we could have this delivered over the Internet from a cloud provider, and it could still apply to localized on-premises data. The Cloud Security Alliance publishes a comprehensive list of recommended practices for each of the Security as a Service offerings. There are many vendors that offer Security as a Service including McAfee, Symantec, and Trend Micro. There are many public cloud providers that offer Security as a Service for items, such as Web and Email, and there are also options for firewalls, anti-malware, log inspection, integrity monitoring, all delivered over the Internet from a cloud provider. In this video, we discussed Security as a Service.
Heading: Security as a Service.

One of the SECaaS service offerings is identity management.

The presenter then navigates to the Google Chrome browser window, which displays the following tabbed pages: ds-saas-web-and-email-protection.pdf and Deep Security as a Service. The ds-saas-web-and-email-protection.pdf tabbed page is open by default. The address bar of this tabbed page displays the following URL:

www.mcafee.com/us/resources/data-sheet/ds-saas-web-and-email-protection.pdf

This page displays information about McAfee SaaS Web and Email Protection.

He then switches to the Deep Security as a Service tabbed page. It displays a Deep Security as a Service from TREND MICRO page. This page contains the following tabs: For Home, For Business, Security Intelligence, Why Trend Micro, and Support. The For Business tab is selected by default.

The path for this page is Home > For Business > Enterprise > Cloud and Data Center Security > Deep Security as a Service.

This page displays information about the Advanced security service built for the cloud. Some information of this section is as follows:

Deep Security as a Service is built on the proven capabilities of the Deep Security platform providing intrusion detection and prevention, firewall, anti-malware, web reputation, log inspection, and integrity monitoring.

### The Cloud Cube Model
In this video, I'll discuss the Cloud Cube Model. The Jericho Forum, otherwise known as the thought-leadership group, was founded in the UK in 2004 and ended in 2013. Here we can see the Jericho Group has documentation available online that talks about selecting different cloud formations for secure collaboration. The purpose of the Jericho Forum was to define and promote the breaking down of security barriers, otherwise called de-perimeterization, and to promote enterprise security collaboration. The Jericho Forum consisted of user and vendor members and also collaborated with the Cloud Security Alliance, CSA, who are still active today. The Cloud Cube Model has a number of cloud formations. The objectives are that not everything is best implemented in clouds. Sometimes, it makes more sense to operate some business functions using a traditional non-cloud approach. Sometimes, you don't have a choice due to regulations. We might have to store data and run services on-premises. Another objective of the Cloud Cube Model is to explain the different cloud formations that the Jericho Forum has identified and described key characteristics, benefits, and risks of each of them.
Heading: The Cloud Cube Model.

In Macintosh OS, the cloud_cube_model_v1.0.pdf is open in the Opera browser window. In this pdf, information related to Cloud Cube Model: Selecting Cloud Formations for Secure Collaboration is displayed.

The white paper on Cloud Cube Model – Selecting Cloud Formations for Secure Collaboration published in April, 2009 provides the definition of available cloud computing formations and the guidance on selecting the most appropriate model.

Finally, the last objective is to provide a framework for exploring the nature of these different cloud formations and the issues that need to be solved to make them usable...to make them safe and secure. We can see that with the Cloud Cube Model, we have to determine whether we are outsourcing specific activities related to IT or insourcing them. We have to determine whether we're going to be running solutions that are proprietary or open source. Let's take a look at the cloud formations. The first is internal and external, where we determine the location of cloud data. Sometimes, it's not black and white. We could have cloud data, but we might be synchronizing it locally, so we still have access to it if we lose our Internet connection. Once the connection comes back up, then any changes we've made locally in offline mode would be synced back up to the cloud. The second cloud formation is proprietary and open, where we determine whether we're using proprietary or open source cloud software. For example, OpenStack is open source cloud software, whereas Microsoft Azure is proprietary.

The third cloud formation deals with perimeterized or de-perimeterized architectures. Now remember, with de-perimeterization, we're really talking about removing boundaries between an organization and the outside world, such as a connection to a cloud service provider. Now at the same time, we need to make sure that the organization's assets are protected, so we have to have a secure solution even though we're moving that boundary between a local network owned by an organization and a public cloud provider. The fourth cloud formation is insourced or outsourced, whereby with outsourced, we look at whether or not the cloud service is provided by a third party. We might even have outsourced services from various third parties. It doesn't have to be all from the same cloud service provider. With insourced, the cloud servicing question is provided and controlled internally. So what's running on assets owned by the organization, such as computer infrastructure, and it's in the complete control of the organization. So in other words, that would be a private cloud. In this video, we discussed the Cloud Cube Model.

### Cloud Network Infrastructure Security
In this video, I'll discuss cloud network infrastructure security. One of the main issues with cloud network infrastructure security is to protect consumer assets that are hosted in a multi-tenant cloud infrastructure. So we've got multiple customers that are using the same physical compute infrastructure. Now data isolation can be put in place by the cloud service provider, but we still need to consider these issues. The cloud infrastructure consists of compute infrastructure; network infrastructure, both of which could be physical or virtual; and storage infrastructure, which could be dedicated to a specific cloud tenant or shared among tenants. SaaS applications are also vulnerable to attack. We don't have control, as cloud service consumers, of how SaaS applications are implemented. We simply use those applications that are hosted by the cloud service provider. Now the one thing we might be able to do is control authentication to those SaaS applications. SaaS applications include items, such as Dropbox, Facebook, Twitter, Office 365, Google Apps, and many others. Other important security elements include whether data integrity and confidentiality are maintained. Integrity assures us that data hasn't been tampered with and that it's authentic. Confidentiality makes sure that data is seen only by authorized users.
Heading: Cloud Network Infrastructure.

The cloud infrastructure consists of compute infrastructure, network infrastructure, and storage infrastructure, all of which must remain secure to achieve required control.

With authentication, we might consider the use of a central identity store through identity federation, which we could also use to enable single sign-on to multiple SaaS applications. Then authorization is seamless and the user doesn't have to keep entering in credentials. It's also important that applications are available. The uptime is listed in the service-level agreement. On the Internet, OWASP has multiple publications dealing with what we should look for with web application security. However, if we aren't developing or testing web applications, we do have little control. Finally, there's virtualization security, where, in the case of, virtual machines we need to make sure one tenant's VMs are kept isolated from another tenant's VMs. This is often referred to as shielded virtual machines. Then there's network-level security. Ideally, all data traversing cloud provider networks, be they physical or virtual, will be secured either through Secure Sockets Layer, SSL, or its successor, Transport Layer Security, TLS. At the same time, all networks must remain available. This is also true at the client or customer's side, where they should have redundant Internet connections, so that if one Internet connection fails, they still have a way to get to the public cloud provider.

The cloud provider should also look at hardware solutions that will deal with failover, if we have failed servers or failed components; port protection; and also traffic management. For Platform as a Service and Software as a Service, the cloud service consumer has really no control over the network infrastructure including its design and security. So the cloud service provider should ensure via the service-level agreement that all network protection security measures are in place. With Infrastructure as a Service, the cloud service consumer does have some control because they are configuring infrastructure, such as network firewalls, virtual networks, even public facing network configurations. Additional network-level security issues are related to attacks, such as denial of service attacks, DNS hacking, routing table and arp cache poisoning, XML denial of service attacks, quality of service issues, man-in-the-middle attacks, and finally spoofing, which is the forging of some kind of transmission, whether it's a packet on the network or an e-mail message sent to an inbox. Now if you're asking yourself wouldn't I have to consider these in terms of network security even on my own on-premises network? And the answer, of course, is yes. We just want to make sure we extend that thought process to the cloud provider network.

The cloud service provider needs to ensure individual client asset integrity. This is done through data isolation. There are other network-level security issues, such as physical access to network equipment in the datacenter. There also needs to be alternate sources of power, in case of a power outage. Normally, in datacenters, that's done with generators. We then have to account for sources of damage to equipment within a physical datacenter, such as water, fire, HVAC, rodents, and so on. Anything that could impede a service running in the datacenter needs to be accounted for. The cloud service consumer should and can request certifications for the cloud service provider related to network security or adopted standards. The called service consumer is completely reliant, remember, on network traffic and incidents reporting data from the cloud service provider. It's out of the control of the cloud service consumer. We should also consider the use of Security as a Service as per the cloud security alliance. Security as a Service offers security mechanisms hosted by the cloud provider. Some of those include things like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, file integrity monitoring, denial of service protection, antivirus protection, traffic flow, and so on. In this video, we talked about cloud network infrastructure security.
Heading: Cloud Network Infrastructure.

Some of the uses of Security as a Service per the cloud security alliance are displayed. The providers of Network Security SecaaS must provide cloud customers with details of data threats, details of access control threats, access and authentication controls, and security gateway such as firewalls, WAF, and SOA/API. The providers of Network Security SecaaS must also provide cloud customers with security products such as IDS/IPS, Server Tier Firewall, File Integrity Monitoring, DLP, and Anti-Spam, and security monitoring and incident response. In addition, the providers of Network Security SecaaS must provide cloud customers with DoS protection/mitigation, Secure "base services" such as DNSSEC, NTP, Oauth, SNMP, management network segmentation and security, traffic/netflow monitoring, and integration with Hypervisor layer.

### Host Level Security
In this video, I'll discuss host-level security. When we talk about a host in the cloud context, we're talking about the hypervisor host, the physical machine, on which multiple virtual machines can run concurrently. Cloud platforms all require physical hosts, storage, and wired networks. But all of those can fail. To mitigate loss and downtime related to their failure, the cloud service provider can implement physical redundancy and security for hardware to make sure that we've got, for example, multiple physical cluster nodes running virtual machines, such that if we have a failure of one physical cluster node or hypervisor host, the virtual machines that it was running can failover to our remaining cluster nod, thus minimizing downtime for those virtual machines. The cloud service provider should also ensure that there is a valid backup policy for data and even replication schedule. For example, the provider might replicate data for all or some cloud customers between datacenters. The provider should also deploy failover techniques not just for hardware, but for running services and databases. They could even deploy load balancing. In some cases, this is offered as a configurable service to cloud customers. Load balancing allows us to distribute network traffic for busy network services.

Finally, the cloud service provider should deploy access control best practices to those host servers. One of the things that would be considered in that case would be the principle of least privilege, whereby we only grant administrators and users privileges they need to complete their job tasks and no more. On the cloud host, there are also hardware and service issues, such as data loss due to power failure. Cloud service provider datacenters need to have alternate ways of getting power. This is usually through backup generators. Then we need to think about data loss due to the lack of physical security. It's important that datacenters have strict physical security to control access into and out of datacenter facilities as well as access to racks of physical computing equipment. At the same time datacenter administrators should not have the ability to go into a customer virtual machine and see the data or its running processes. There's also data loss due to poor redundancy. If we have a failed server or we only have a single backup of data, we want to make sure that we have an alternate to go to if it's corrupt. So having a single instance of backup information, for example, is a poor practice, both for cloud service providers as well as for cloud consumers.

There could also be data loss due to network outages. Sometimes, if we're in the midst of writing something over a network to the cloud, or to on-premises, or for in the middle of synchronizing something, we could either lose the data entirely, or it could be corrupt, or truncated. So again, we fall back on reliable backup mechanisms. Regardless of the operating system and its operation, the following can assist in establishing security. We need strong authentication policies that are applied to cloud hosts. This usually means the use of multifactor authentication. So instead of allowing authentication to cloud host servers simply through username and password, there might also be biometric authentication through fingerprint scanners, or the use of smart cards, or PKI certificates. After successful authentication, then personnel on the datacenter would be authorized to access cloud host servers. There should also be a strong password policy, if passwords are being used. Firewalls can also be used to allow or restrict certain types of traffic to and from different locations.

Host servers should also have frequent backups and there should be multiple copies of backups stored in alternate locations. This is where cloud service providers will often replicate to other datacenters. Operating system updates will periodically need to be applied to the cloud host servers. Often what happens is any resource running on those host servers are drained or moved over to other running servers, so that we can update and potentially reboot a cloud host that requires updates, then the services that were running in the past get placed back on that host. And we can use shielded virtual machines, which allow isolation between different tenant virtual machines. One way to do this is using SELinux. If the cloud service provider is using the Linux operating system to run virtual machines, then they might consider the use of SELinux, which stands for Security-Enhanced Linux. Here at the command prompt, on my Linux host, I've typed getenforce and it returns "Enforcing", which means that SELinux is active. This is relevant because SELinux can allow for isolation between different resources, such as virtual machines. Here in Linux, I can issue the virsh, as in virtual shell, space, list, space, --all command to list virtual machines. Here we can see, we've got two of them,
The root@rhel71-2:~ terminal command prompt window is displayed in the Linux application. At the bottom of the command prompt window, root@rhel71-2:/vm_disks, root@rhel71-2:~, and root@rhel71-2:~ tabs are displayed. The third tabbed page, root@rhel71-2:~, is open by default and at the [root@rhel71-2 ~] command prompt, the getenforce command is entered and the result, Enforcing, is displayed.

The presenter navigates to the second tabbed page, root@rhel71-2:~, and at the [root@rhel71-2:~] command prompt, the virsh list -- all command is displayed. As a result, a table with two rows and three columns is displayed. The columns are ID, Name, and State. The rows are as follows:

For Id 2, Name is rhel7.0 and State is running; and for Id 3, Name is dbserv and State is running.

Then the virsh dumpxml dbserv | grep svirt command is displayed at the [root@rhel71-2 ~] command prompt.

and can also use the virsh dumpxml command against a certain virtual machine, here dbserv, where I can pipe the results to grep to filter out the output looking for svirt. What I would see here is for dbserv running virtual machine, it's got specific labels, such as c900 and c984. This is part of SELinux and its mandatory access control labeling. If I look at the virtual hard disks in use by that virtual machine, I will see that it's using the same labeling, in this case, c900 and c984. So what does this all mean? We can see the relationship with the 900 and the 984 for the virtual machine hard disk file and the running virtual machine. Well, the relationship is that the virtual machine can only access resources that are labeled in the same way. And this allows for virtual machine shielding or isolation among multiple cloud tenants. In this video, we discussed host-level security.
The root@rhel71-2:~ terminal command prompt window is displayed and the root@rhel71-2:~ tabbed page is open. On this tabbed page, at the [root@rhel71-2 ~] command prompt, the virsh dumpxml dbserv | grep svirt command is displayed. The presenter runs this command and the following is displayed:

<label>system_u:sysem_r:svirt_tcg_t:s0:c900,c984</label>
<imagelabel>system_u:object_r:svirt_image_t:s0c900,c984</imagelabel>

Then in the command prompt window, the presenter navigates to the root@rhel71-2:/vm_disks tabbed page. On this tabbed page, at the [root@rhel71-2 vm_disks] command prompt, the following command is displayed:

ls –laZ

The output that is displayed for this command is as follows:

drwxr-xr-x. root root system_u:object_r:default_t:s0
dr-xr-xr-x. root root system_u:object_r:root_t:s0
- rw-------. qemu qemu system_u:object_r:svirt_image_t:s0:c900,c984 dbserv.qcow2
drwx------. root root system_u:object_r:default_t:s0 lost+found
- rw-------. qemu qemu system_u:object_r:svirt_image_t:s0:c741 ,c768 webserv.qcow2

From this output, he highlights the following: c900,c984 dbserv.qcow2.

He then navigates to the root@rhel71-2:~ tabbed page and highlights the label values c900,c984.

### Virtualization Host Security
In this video, I'll discuss virtualization host security. Virtualization has allowed for the rapid growth of cloud computing through its adoption by cloud service providers. We can virtualize many items including virtual machines and virtual networks. The benefits to virtualization include elastic and rapid resource provisioning. If we need, let's say, to fire up a number of virtual machines for a project that can be done in minutes through the cloud. Whereas, in the past, we would have to order hardware for those servers that we need, wait for it to arrive, then install the operating systems, and so on. At the same time, it's very quick and easy to deprovision virtual machines when we no longer need them and we're only paying for what we use. So there's also that cost benefit. With virtualization, we can share physical resources. Many different cloud tenants could have virtual machines all running on a single set of hardware. At the same time, it's also important that service and application data be kept isolated between cloud customers, which is entirely possible. Virtualization is considered a green solution because instead of having 100 separate physical servers, for example, they could all be running as virtual machines on one set of hardware at the same time. So it's less power consumption, less cooling required, and so on.

Virtualization can also offer improved disaster recovery or failover management benefits. We could have virtualization hosts as cluster nodes. So if one fails, the virtual machines it was running will be failed over to a remaining cluster node. In terms of disaster recovery, we have the option of using virtual machine snapshots or checkpoints do the same thing. And we can apply those checkpoints or snapshots to return the virtual machine to an earlier point in time. With virtualization, there is a reduction in vendor lock-in. And that's because virtualization is pretty much standardized. If cloud service provider A is allowing us to run virtual machines in their cloud infrastructure, we should be able to migrate those virtual machines to cloud provider B. And if they're not the same format, there are many available tools on the Internet to convert between various types of virtual machine settings. But like all good things, there are also drawbacks. With virtualization, we've got a lot of eggs in a single basket if we're not clustering. That means we could have many virtual machines running at the same time on one physical server. What happens then if that physical server fails in some way, even if its network connectivity fails? We have a problem because none of the virtual machines will be available. It's crucial with virtualization that we have some kind of a failover clustering solution, so that if one physical host or a component on one host fails, virtual machines can be failed over to another one.

Now there is a double-edged sword in that. We have great recovery options with virtual machines in terms of the fact that we've got snapshots and checkpoints, but at the same time that could also be a drawback, whereby we might have to configure backup agents within each virtual machine to recover lost information as well as setting up backup for the virtualization host itself. So it's almost like we're backing things up twice. But that might be necessary in some cases. In terms of application support, some apps will not work correctly in a virtualized environment. They may, for example, need to talk directly to a specific type of hardware that isn't supported in the virtualization environment. And also, a single misbehaving virtual machine could negatively impact other virtual machines running on that same host. Other areas of concern are related to the Cloud Security Alliance Domain 13, where they list virtual machine guest operating system security. Just because we have a virtual machine running an operating system, doesn't mean it doesn't need to be hardened or secured as if it were running on a physical host. It still needs to be updated. It needs to be hardened. We need to follow security best practices and so on. This can be done through the use of templates in a large-scale environment, such as a cloud service provider network.

We also have to think about the hypervisor running on the host physical computer. It also needs to be hardened. Then there are client asset vulnerabilities, such as stored data, in which case, we might consider using encryption to protect that information. With Domain 13, the Cloud Security Alliance also provides many recommendations to limit security issues inherent in a virtualized environment. Part of that would include doing things like applying updates and so on. So we need to harden each virtual machine just as we would if it were physically running on physical hardware. We need to harden the hypervisor. We need to make sure virtual machines are isolated at least at the tenant level. This can be done using mandatory access control mechanisms built into the hypervisor operating system or through other tools. Virtual machine sprawl is an interesting problem. Because it's so easy and quick to provision virtual machines, what can happen over time is we've got plenty of virtual machines running that perhaps we forgotten about and they're no longer required.

So it's a waste of performance resources as well as paying for something that you're not using. So often cloud service providers will have tools, where we can do a query to determine virtual machines that have been accessed in a period of time. We can also consider encrypting virtual machines. In essence, virtual machines are collections of files, each of which can be encrypted to protect it from other tenants in a cloud computing environment. Finally, we want to make sure that when virtual machines are removed or destroyed that there are no remnants that remain, so that other cloud tenants or malicious users could get access to the data in them. Think about the fact that a virtual machine will use at least one virtual hard disk file. It's just a file. And often, those files can be mounted at the command line or in GUI tools, so that people could poke around and see what was in the virtual hard disk. So when we talk about virtual machine destruction, really, we're talking about the secure deletion of files related to virtual machines. In this video, we discussed virtualization host security.

### Application Level Security
In this video, I'll talk about application-level security. Application-level threats include unauthorized use of applications and unauthorized access to the underlying data that results from those applications. This could even take the form of, for example, a stolen smartphone that has an app installed, whereby there is access granted to sensitive data stored in the cloud. Application-level security threats include Cross-site scripting attacks, cookie poisoning, hidden field manipulation, SQL injection attacks, denial of service attacks, even Google hacking, where data that wasn't intended to be made public is made available publicly and can be used to get into an application or to access sensitive data. We have the option of migrating legacy applications to the cloud. If this is the case, then it means that the cloud consumer loses some control over the application. The reason for this is because it's no longer running on equipment or infrastructure owned by the consumer. Instead, it's running in the cloud on the cloud provider's infrastructure. So therefore, there would be a reliance on the cloud service provider to protect the application and the resultant data. Now the consumer can do some things to protect the data, such as encrypting it out of band, using a third-party tool to encrypt data that results from that application.

Inadequate identity and authorization control is also problematic in the cloud. It can diminish asset integrity because the data may not be trustworthy if we can't assure it's not been tampered with. When developers build applications on a Platform as a Service platform, then it is the client that is responsible for application security, not the cloud service provider because the client is building the application. It's just being hosted in the cloud environment. Passive data or data that's not currently being used but stored, often also called data at rest as well as data in transit, needs to be encrypted. And we need to have data isolation in a multi-tenant environment, such that the data from one cloud tenant cannot be accessed by other cloud tenants. One way to do this is to ensure that we are enabling encryption, for example, even at the virtual machine hard disk level.

Additional application-level security considerations include issues, such as spoofing or forging something, such as a packet or a transmission to a web application; tampering with data; repudiation, where we can deny that something was done even though it was logged because we can't prove where a transmission, for example, came from. There's also the issue of privilege elevation. If applications aren't coded properly with the correct checks and balances put in place, then it's possible for a malicious user to get privilege elevation. Unauthorized disclosure of data or data leakage is also possible. And, of course, denial of service could make an application unusable for legitimate purposes. This could be done by flooding a network with useless traffic or even by crashing a web application. Well-designed identity, entitlement, and access management mechanisms, also known as IdEA, will mitigate most of the above listed threats. Domain 12 of the Cloud Security Alliance guide deals with IdEA. If you're looking for more details related to IdEA, bear in mind that the Cloud Security Alliance makes their publications freely available to anybody that's interested on the Internet. Here we can see the Cloud Security Alliance publication related to Domain 12: Guidance for Identity & Access management.

On this tabbed page, the CSA guide for Domain 12 is displayed.

The Cloud Security Alliance and the application layer are discussed in Domain 10. This deals with the adoption of a secure software development life cycle, whereby security is dealt with through each phase of system development. Additional application layer security considerations include the lack of the client's control over security because it's being hosted by the cloud provider. The lack of visibility over application security policy is also potentially problematic. In some cases, cloud providers will allow customers to build policies to control security aspects of software that they're delivering through the cloud. With manageability, a lack of access to auditing and access policy could also be problematic. Again, some cloud providers are good about this and will give a web interface to customers, so that they can take a look at audit logs related to application and data access and even the option of configuring access policies. But in the end, there is a lack of client control over infrastructure and inherent security. So in other words, we have a lot of trust then in the cloud service provider and their security mechanisms that they say are in place.

There are also compliance risks. The cloud consumer has no influence over applied standards, asset security, privacy measures, and so on. However, bear in mind that cloud consumers can ask providers for audit results or compliance frameworks that the cloud provider is adhering too. It's always important to isolate application instances running in the cloud between different tenants, data that's stored in memory, data that is stored, and data that's being transmitted. It's important that deletions are also done in a secured manner. We want to make sure other cloud tenants can't retrieve data that was removed from other cloud tenants. It's important that we have secure interfaces, so that we have a secured way to get into our management tools, whereby we can control some of our cloud services. Ideally, this would be done through a web interface over HTTPS. Finally, we can also use Access Control Lists, or ACLs, to determine resource access for groups of users.

OWASP has publications on the Internet related to application security for web applications. There are a number of testing recommendations, whereby there are Business Logic Testing, Authentication and Authorization Testing, Session Management Testing, Data Validation Testing, which is important. We want to make sure if we allow users to input data into an application of some kind that that data is valid and is formatted correctly. OWASP also deals with the denial of service testing for application testing and Ajax Testing. Ajax is Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, which developers could use to build various web services. As is the case with Cloud Security Alliance publications on the Internet, OWASP makes all of their publications freely available to everybody on the Internet. Here we can see the OWASP Testing Guide v4 and we're looking at the Table of Contents, where we could scroll through and learn about the proper techniques used for testing web application security. In this video, we discussed application-level security.

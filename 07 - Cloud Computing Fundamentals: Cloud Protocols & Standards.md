### Cloud Standards
[Video description begins] Topic title: Cloud Standards. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
Cloud services are, of course, fairly new in the world of technology, so it can impede sometimes the adoption of cloud services because there aren't really any official standards with respect to who controls all cloud services and/or the way that they're managed. So we aren't really seeing a lot of cloud standards, but we are seeing some emerging standards. So with respect to some of the background and/or the current status of cloud services, there is no single authoritative cloud standards body. Now there are many proprietary APIs, application programming interfaces, that have been adopted as de facto standards, but without any kind of official general industry agreement. And what those refer to are things like at the development level. Amazon web services, one of the standard providers, they are widely adopted as the de facto standard. So you know, amongst the people who are developing within cloud services that has become something that's fairly common, but it is still yet to achieve any kind of official standardization.

So in this environment, provider comparison does become difficult. A common standardized cloud security practice does not exist, and provider operational performance metrics cannot really be compared. So it can be difficult particularly if you are trying to, let's say, convince your organization to move toward cloud-based services when there aren't any official standards for you to say, you know, here...look this is what has to be maintained. This is the way cloud services have to operate because they simply don't exist. So as mentioned, at this time, no single standard governs the development, provisioning, use, or governance of cloud services and APIs. But as mentioned, as well, there are certain overarching standards that do apply to data and data storage and associated legal provisions and protections. So with respect to just storing data within a cloud environment, there certainly are regulations and standards in place there, generally location-based, for example, in the US or the European Union. And Service Level Agreements usually provides for some kind of user provider protection when it comes to that data.

So, you know, there were certain aspects of cloud services that are falling under standardization or classification, if you will, as to how these services need to be provisioned. The CSA, the Cloud Security Alliance, they have this security guidance document, which is founded on continuous observation of applicable standards in all of the 14 identified domains of consideration. And those are the areas of cloud services that they have identified as needing to be addressed, if you will, with respect to how the services should be offered. So the Cloud Standards Customer Council, or CSCC, is another emerging organization that publishes a number of guidance papers to develop awareness, adoption, and standardization of cloud services. They have a practical guide to cloud service agreements V2.0; Security for cloud computing, 10 steps to ensure success; web application hosting and cloud architecture; interoperability and portability for cloud computing, a Guide; then migrating applications to the cloud, assessing performance and response time requirements; the CSCC practical guide to cloud computing;migrating applications to public cloud services, a roadmap for success; and cloud security standards, what to expect and negotiate.

But again, these are not official standards. They are all just guides. So they certainly can help. But there is still no governing body that says these things must be adhered to or must be implemented in this kind of fashion. The cloud standards organization is a grouping of interested parties that publishes the status of each member cloud related standard on their self-maintained WIKI page. WIKI means that each of those interested parties contributes to the content. So this is another emerging group and the current status of emerging and applied standards can be used as a first call reference point when considering the adoption or development of cloud technologies. And you see there is the URL there. [Video description begins] The URL is: http://cloud-standards.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page. [Video description ends] But again, this is still just an organization that is publishing guidance documentation, still nothing that has become any kind of standard.

Now the ISO, the International Standards Organization 20000-7 is in development. This is application of ISO and IEC in the cloud environment. And ISO 20000 is dealing anything with Information Technology Systems Management. So it's trying to put all these together, if you will, and is currently being developed. As of February 2012, it was a draft that they were still working on. The Working title, service management part 7, guidance on the application of ISO/IEC to the cloud. So it is hoped that this will become an international standard that will give guidance on the application as it applies to cloud computing. So again, it's all about IT systems management, but specifically in the cloud. So basically they're trying to put the two together into an international standard.

And finally, the National Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST - U.S.A. cloud computing program, this is designed to provide leadership and guidance around the cloud computing and promote adoption within the industry and government to encourage the adoption of cloud computing, and to reduce the adoption cycles of cloud computing, and to educate and advise via whitepapers and calls for discussion and simply to develop standards. So you know, again, all of these are basically just emerging standards. Nothing has been officially adopted. There is still no governing body, but at least we're seeing these organizations that are interested in promoting this type of technology and educating and, again, you know, encouraging people to move towards cloud-based services. And again, we do see the URL for their documentation there. So like a lot of things, it does require a bit of research particularly if you are an organization that does require a lot of regulatory compliance. So there might be some research involved before moving to a cloud-based solution. But hopefully, some of these will be adopted as standards and then, you know, when you go with any provider that meets those standards, you know exactly what you're going to get. [Video description begins] The URL for National Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST documentation is as follows:HTTP://www.NIST.gov/itl/cloud/ [Video description ends]

### Cloud Standards Groups
[Video description begins] Topic title: Cloud Standards Groups. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
Although there aren't as yet any official cloud standards, there are a number of cloud standards groups that are trying to move toward these standards and effectively enhanced consumer confidence in cloud services. So one of the first ones is called the cloud standards customer council and this was founded by IBM and a few others. [Video description begins] The URL for Cloud Standards Customer Council is: https://www.cloud-council.org/. [Video description ends] And the CSCC is an umbrella organization promoting and supporting cloud standards and cloud direction. So you see while the statement here, it is an end user advocacy group dedicated to accelerating the cloud's successful adoption, and drilling down into the standards, security, interoperability, and various other issues that are surrounding any kind of transition to the cloud. So as mentioned, they're just trying to promote a little more confidence on the side of the consumer. And its membership, you see here includes very large multinational companies including Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, ATT, etcetera because, of course, they all offer cloud services. So the hope is to boost the confidence from the consumer's perspective so that they'll be a little more at ease when they do transition to a cloud type of service.

There is also the cloud security alliance and its membership includes SAP, Microsoft as well, HP etcetera and these actually do provide some certification [Video description begins] The URL for Cloud Security Alliance or CSA is https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/ [Video description ends] and training with respect to implementation of cloud services. They also publish the security guidance for critical areas of focus in cloud computing, and they publish a cloud control matrix. So they can help you to understand what needs to be in place when you are moving toward a cloud-based solution. Now they also actively monitor and map to the work of various other [Video description begins] The URL for the Cloud Control Matrix is HTTPs://cloudsecurityalliance.org/download/cloud-controls-matrix-v3-0-1/ [Video description ends] standard agencies whether they're involved with cloud services or not and they include DMTF, ODCA, the RAISE Forum, SNIA, and E-N-I-S-A or ENISA. And we'll talk what each of these in a moment. But as mentioned, they're all just various other agencies that maintain standards and regulations for various components of technology and security.

So with this, the cloud security alliance also maintains the security, trust, and assurance registry; a publicly accessible registry designed to recognize the varying assurance requirements and maturity levels of providers and consumers and is used by customers, providers, industries, governments, etcetera. So again, what we're seeing here is effectively the cloud [Video description begins] The URL for Cloud Security Alliance or CSA is HTTPs://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/?r=8603#star_m [Video description ends] providers wanting to boost the confidence of the customers so that they are assured in things like security, and trust, and, of course, the validity of the services they offer. So some of those other agencies as mentioned the European Telecommunications Standards Institute or ETSI, they do offer a cloud standard coordination report that you can access at that URL there. The National Institute of Standards and Technology

[Video description begins] The URL for the Cloud Standard Coordination Report is: http://www.etsi.org/images/files/Events/2013/2013_CSC_Delivery_WS/CSC-Final_report-013-CSC_Final_report_V1_0_PDF_format-.PDF [Video description ends] or NIST, they have a cloud standard roadmap. The DMTF, the Distributed Management Task Force, [Video description begins] The URL for NIST is: http://www.computer.org/web/ieee cloudcomputing/standards#sthash.pWP821DO.dpuf [Video description ends] they develop and publish numerous cloud standards. Members include Microsoft, Cisco, Lenovo, etcetera. [Video description begins] The URL for DMTF is: http://dmtf.org/ [Video description ends]

OASIS which is the Organization for Advancement of Structured Information Standards, they maintain a topology and orchestration specification for cloud applications or more simply known as TOSCA. The RAISE Forum, which is the Regional Asia Information Security Exchange Forum, the ODCA is the Open Data Center Alliance, and The Open Group, where the membership is dedicated to establishing open, vendor-neutral IT standards and certifications in a variety of subject areas that are critical to the enterprise. So all of these organizations, again, offer various standards within various sections of information technology and some may or may not equate to cloud services. But when you pull them all together, things like the cloud security alliance and the CSCC that was mentioned previously can draw from them and hopefully establish moving forward a set of standards that will always be applicable to cloud services

[Video description begins] The URL for Oasis Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications or TOSCA is HTTPs://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.PHP?wg_abbrev=tosca. For the RAISE forum, the URL is HTTP://raiseforum.org/; for ODCA, it is HTTP://www.opendatacenteralliance.org/; and for the Open Group, it is HTTP://www.opengroup.org. [Video description ends]

### Cloud Security Protocols
[Video description begins] Topic title: Cloud Security Protocols. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]

As far as cloud protocols and standards are concerned, we are still dealing with an immature technology. Cloud computing simply has not been around that long. So with respect to the standards as we've discussed, there really aren't any that are officially in place. But a number of general IT security standards can be applied within the cloud computing environment. So these emerging cloud security standards can be classified within one of three categories or possibly several depends of course on the organization and what it is you need. But with respect to those classifications, we're seeing advisory standards, security frameworks, and standards specifications. Now with the advisory standards, they're the most broadly scoped. They're flexible enough to be adopted, and managed, and targeted at various levels for smaller to larger organizations. So, you know, advisory as the name sort of suggest, is just guidelines, suggestions, recommendations.

The Security framework includes things like best practices. Now these are still just recommendations but when applied, they are, in fact, capable of garnering certifications. They also allow for auditing, testing, and conformance of various practices. Standards specifications then tend to be the most specific as its name indicates. These are targeted at application programming interface definitions and communication protocols, which must comply with the associated standard. So again, it's nothing that is specifically targeted at cloud services, but within any given section of cloud services, a standard specification may be applicable. So with respect to some cloud standards security protocols, many of these, again, aren't specifically targeted at cloud computing services, but they may be applicable given any particular area of focus. So some of these standards include the ISO, which is the International Standards Organization, 38500, which covers IT governance; ITIL, which is the IT Information Library. They cover IT Service Management practices. COBIT, which is the Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology.
They have a subsidiary association known as the Information Systems Audit and Control Association, which supports policy development and good practice for organization-wide IT control and they emphasize things like regulatory compliance. SSAE is the statement on standards for attestation engagements, document number 165. And then ISO has a number of standards in development. 20000-7 cover general IT service management standards and then the -7 is going to apply that to cloud computing. And then 27001, information security management system standards, and 27002, best practice guidelines for organizational information security standards and information security management practices. So again, these are all, sort of, hovering around or within the cloud environment, but not yet specifically targeted at cloud services. Finally, some other regional and industry focused standards include the HIPAA, which is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. This relates, of course, to storage of health related data in information, which definitely has a lot of privacy concerns. The PCI-DSS is the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which obviously relates then to the methods of payment, storing credit card information, for example. FedRAMP is the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program. This is a US government program providing a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services.

And finally, FISMA, the Federal Information Security Management Act, a US federal law that imposes data and information security requirements on various federal agencies. So, you know, again the idea is that none of these are specifically targeted at cloud services, but they all have something to do with particular areas of focus within cloud services. So until there is a standard that is specifically focused on cloud services, these organizations help to maintain at least some components with respect to security standards and protocols within cloud services.

### Cloud Security Recommendations
[Video description begins] Topic title: Cloud Security Recommendations. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
Since there is no single governing body or set of officially adopted standards with respect to all cloud services, some of the security protocols that you might want to implement simply don't have officially governed regulations in place. So the Cloud Standards Customer Council has released and maintains a recommendation for cloud security and it's a ten step process and they have a matrix that goes along with this that we'll see in a moment. But each of these steps basically, as the name suggests, are just recommendations. But if you follow these, then you should be able to implement a reasonably secure solution within the cloud. So for starters, in Step 1, we see to ensure effective governance, risk, and compliance, processes exist with your provider; audit the operational and business processes; manage the people, the roles, and the identities; ensure a proper protection of data and information; enforce the privacy policies; assess the security provisions for cloud applications; ensure cloud networks and connections are secure; evaluate the security controls on physical infrastructure and facilities; manage security terms in the cloud Service Level Agreement (SLA); and understand the security requirements of the exit process as well.

So looking at each of those in greater detail as mentioned, we see this matrix here, wherein for each step, they give you the Standards

[Video description begins] The CSCC standards recommendation for cloud security and data management table is displayed. This table contains two rows and the following three columns: steps, Standard Recommendations, and Certification Recommendations. For Step 1: Ensure effective GRC processes exit, the Standard Recommendations are as follows: Ensure CSP complies with COBIT, ISO 20000, SSAE 16, or ITIL depending on type of workload Ensure CSP conforms to the ISO 27001 and ISO 27002 standards for information systems security. Once ISO 27017 and ISO 27018 are completed, ensure CSP conforms to these standards. The Certification Recommendations for Step 1 are as follows: Insist on ISO 27002 today and ISO 27017 certification when it becomes available. For cloud services with impact on financial activities, seek SSAE 16 certification. For Step 2: Audit operational and business processes, the Standard Recommendations are as follows: Ensure CSP complies with SSAE 16. Ensure CSP conforms to the ISO 20007 series of standards. In the 2014 timeframe, determine if CSP supports DMTF CADF. The Certification Recommendations for Step 2 are as follows: Insist on ISO 27002 certification today and ISO 27017 certification when it becomes available. For cloud services with impact on financial activities, seek SSAE 16 certification. [Video description ends]

Recommendations and if applicable any Certification Recommendations as well. So in terms of ensuring effective GRC that's Governance Risk and Compliance and making sure they exist, you can see that there is quite a list there of other standards that will be applicable to the governance, risk, and compliance. So various organizations including COBIT, ISO 20000, SSAE 16, and ITIL depending on the type of workload and simply ensuring that your cloud service provider conforms to those already in place standards and/or security protocols. Now as we've discussed previously those ones aren't specific to cloud services, but they do relate to just overall security.

So there are certifications that go along with some of those standards as well. So we see in the matrix effectively what recommendation you should have and then the certification that is applicable to that. So in Step 2, for the audit operational and business processes, we see that we want them to comply with SSAE 16, ISO 20007, and in the 2014 timeframe, determine if your service provider supports DMTF and/or CADF, which were discussed previously as well. And again, there are certifications that follow along with those standards. In Step 3, managing the people, the roles, and the identities...ensure

[Video description begins] The CSCC standards recommendation for cloud security and data management table for Steps 3 and 4 is displayed. For Step 3: Manage people, roles, and identities, the Standard Recommendations are as follows: Ensure CSP supports federated IDs and single sign-on using one or more of the following standards: LDAP, SAML 2.0, OAuth2.0, WS-Federation, Open ID connect, SCIM. Ensure CSP provides access control and security policy decisions leveraging a standard, such as XACML. Ensure CSP supports one or more of the following standards for security certification: PKCS, X.509, and OpenPGP. The Certification Recommendations for Step 3 are as follows: Insist on ISO 27002 certification, which provides a framework to ensure cloud service provider has proper controls in place to manage people, roles, and identities. Insist on ISO 27017 certification when it becomes available. For Step 4: Ensure proper protection of data and information, the Standard Recommendations are as follows: Ensure CSP supports one or more of the following standards for data in motion: HTTPS, SFTP, VPN using IPsec or SSL. Ensure that CSP supports one or more of the encryption standards defined in US FIPS 140-2. Ensure CSP securely manages security keys using a standard such as OASIS KMIP. The Certification Recommendations for Step 4 are as follows: Insist on ISO 27002 certification, which provides a framework to ensure cloud service provider has proper controls in place to manage people, roles, and identities. Insist on ISO 27017 certification when it becomes available. The [Video description ends]

that your cloud service provider supports things like federated identities, Single Sign-On using a various number of standards, LDAP, Security Association Markup Language, Open Authentication, things like that.

Ensure that they have various access control and security policies in place, such as XACML. Ensure that they support certificates, public key cryptography, X.509 certificates, things like that, and, of course, again the appropriate certifications along with those. As far as proper protection of data and information goes ensuring that they have protection for data in motion or VPNs, for example. HTTP secured, secured FTP using IP security or SSL, protecting information with encryption standard, such as US FIPS and or various key management protocols. And again, several of those have certifications that go along with them. Enforcing privacy policies...ensure that the CSP supports US or EU

[Video description begins] CSCC standards recommendation for cloud security and data management table for Steps 5 and 6 is then displayed. For Step 5: Enforce privacy policies, the Standards Recommendations are as follows: Ensure CSP supports US – EU Safe Harbor framework. Ensure CSP conforms with ISO 27018 when finalized. The Certification Recommendations for Step 5 are as follows: Leverage commercial certification offerings, such as the TRUSTe Safe Harbor certification seal program. Insist on ISO 27017 when it becomes available. For Step 6: Access the security provisions for cloud apps, the Standards Recommendations is as follows: Ensure CSP supports technologies and techniques to protect applications in the cloud including firewalls, VPNs, and DoS countermeasures. The Certification Recommendations for Step 6 are as follows: Insist on ISO 27002 certification, which provides a framework to ensure cloud service provider has proper controls in place to protect cloud applications Insist on ISO 27017 certification when it becomes available. [Video description ends]

Safe Harbor Framework and/or conform us with ISO 27018 one finalized. And Step 6...assess the security provisions for the cloud applications ensuring that they support technologies and techniques to protect the applications including firewalls, VPNs and denial-of-service counter measures; and ensuring the cloud and network connections are secure; support the ISO/IEC

[Video description begins] The CSCC standards recommendation for cloud security and data management table for Steps 7 and 8 is displayed. For Step 7: Ensure cloud networks and connections are secure, the Standard Recommendations are as follows: Ensure CSP supports the ISO/IEC27033 standards, Related work includes OpenFlow, TM Forum Framework, FIPS 199, FIPS 200, NIST SP 800-53. The Certification Recommendations for Step 7 are as follows: Insist on ISO 27002 certification, which provides detailed guidance on implementing network security controls. Insist on ISO 27017 certification when it becomes available. For Step 8: Evaluate security controls on physical infrastructure and facilities, the Standard Recommendations are as follows: Ensure CSP conforms to the ISO 27002 standard for information systems security. Once ISO 27017 and ISO 27018 are completed, ensure CSP conforms to these standards. The Certification Recommendations for Step 8 are as follows: Insist on ISO 27002 certification today and ISO 27017 certification when it becomes available. [Video description ends]

27033 standards, again, a number of forums and frameworks that are listed there.

Step 8: Evaluating the security controls on physical infrastructure. Again, we see ISO 27002, standard for Information Security Systems, various other ones that are still in development. And managing security in terms of the Cloud Service Level Agreement...there

[Video description begins] The CSCC standards recommendation for cloud security and data management table for Steps 9 and 10 is also displayed. For Step 9: Manage security terms in cloud SLA, the Standard Recommendations are as follows: Currently no finalized standards to support real-time assessment of security items in cloud SLA. Related work includes ISO 27004:2009, NIST SP 800-55, CIS Consensus Security Metrics V1.1.0, ENISA. TM Forum actively working on end-to-end SLA Management. The Certification Standards for Step 9 are as follows: For periodic assessments, insist on ISO 27002 certification today and ISO 27017 certification when it becomes available. For cloud services with impact on financial activities, seek SSAE 16 certification (periodic assessment). For Step 10, Understand the security requirements of exit process, currently there are no finalized Standard Recommendations and the future work in this space is proposed for ISO SC38 WG3. In addition, no Certification Recommendations are currently present in this space. [Video description ends]

currently is no finalized standard to support that, but related works, again, include various protocols and specifications from ISO, NIST and ENISA. And finally, understanding the security requirements of the exit process future work only proposed for this currently. But, again, under ISO and various other organizations. So you know there's a lot of stuff in there obviously that you might have to research on your own. But what it comes down to is that there are a fairly high number of standards that are applicable to the cloud. They're just not specifically and officially yet adopted for the cloud. So ultimately, what you want to do is just determine if your cloud service provider is meeting as many of these standards as possible to, of course, enhance and boost the customer assurance and confidence in that provider should they go with their services.

### Cloud Protocols and Standards
[Video description begins] Topic title: Cloud Protocols and Standards. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
Some other cloud standards and protocols that do relate to cloud services include the International Standards Organization 20000-1 Part 1. And we've seen here, this is a service management system, an IT SMS standard. It specifies requirements for the service provider to plan, establish, implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain, and improve an SMS. The requirement includes the design, transition, delivery, and improvement of services to fulfill agreed service requirements. Now again, this is not specifically targeted at cloud services, but at the end of the day, cloud services are still related to IT management system. So this is very applicable to a cloud service environment. So even though it is not yet an adopted standard for cloud service providers, as a customer, you would probably want to know that your cloud

service provider does adhere to that particular standard. NIST, another organization that maintains a number of IT management protocols and standards. This is the National Institute of Standards and Technology. They do, in fact, have a definition of cloud computing as of September 2011. Basically this is a publication that you can search up yourself. It is number 800-145 and it simply defines as the name specifies here what cloud computing is all about. So it helps the customer understand what kind of services should be delivered by a provider. They also have the Cloud Computing Reference Architecture, also in September 2011, which is a Technology Special Publication, number 500-292. So again, both of these are designed to help you understand what should be delivered by a cloud service provider even though they aren't specifically geared toward cloud services.

There is other ISO cloud-related published standards and this is the International Standards Organization. 17788 outlines definitions of cloud computing terminology. For example, Software as a Service, or SaaS, and defines the difference between public and private cloud deployments. And 17789 focuses on cloud computing reference architecture. [Video description begins] The URL for ISO/IEC 17788 is HTTP://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=60544 . [Video description ends] Its standards include diagrams and descriptions of how the various aspects and elements of cloud computing interrelate. And finally, the IEEE, a number, of course, of [Video description begins] The URL for ISO/IEC 17789 is HTTP://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=60545. [Video description ends] standards that exist in the IT world come from IEEE. They have a few publications as well. P2301, Cloud Profiles, this provides information for different cloud participants, such as the cloud vendors, service providers, and users. And P2302, Intercloud, defines topology, functions, and governance for cloud-to-cloud interoperability and federation. [Video description begins] The statement for P2301 (Cloud Profiles) is as follows: The purpose of P2301 Cloud Profiles guide is to assist cloud computing vendors and users in developing, building, and using standards-based cloud computing products and services, which should lead to increased portability, commonality, and interoperability. The statement for P2302 (Intercloud) is as follows: The P2302 Intercloud standard creates an economy among cloud providers that is transparent to users and applications, which provides for a dynamic infrastructure that can support evolving business models. [Video description ends] So again, just more useful documents that you can search up to help you understand what should be offered by a cloud service provider and what you can expect should you choose to subscribe to their services.

### Cloud APIs
[Video description begins] Topic title: Cloud APIs. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
Cloud APIs, or application programming interfaces, are in essence what the user sees within the cloud environment of their provider. So when you sign up with any given provider, you will log into their web page using your account and in essence, you are seeing their APIs. So what we have are various cloud-specific APIs that are deployed to help you build your applications on a cloud computing platform and environment. You see all of the tools available to construct whatever it is that you need in your particular subscription. So the cloud APIs are grouped and/or categorized by service. Now some of them have cross-platform capabilities. So depending on what you are taking advantage of within the cloud, you may see some consistent APIs or some very specific ones for a particular task.

So for example, the PaaS is the Platform as a Service level and within this, we're seeing APIs that are deployed to provide access and functionality for a cloud environment usually with integration with databases, messaging system, portals, and storage components being the focus. At the Software as a Service level, here we're seeing an application-level layer. These APIs are deployed to connect the application layer with the cloud and the underlying IT infrastructure. So at this point, we're talking about taking advantage of existing software. But it needs to be able to connect with the underlying IT infrastructure, the storage, and the virtual machines, and things like that. The infrastructure-level is where we see the IaaS, the Infrastructure as a Service, and they assist in controlling specific cloud resources. For example, the rapid provisioning or deprovisioning of cloud resources like workloads, virtual machine management, and storage pool management. So this is typically your lowest level, but each of them have their own specific APIs to allow you to define and configure these resources.

So cloud provider and cross-platform APIs used for integration and access to cross-cloud resources, they can save time and improve development efforts, since organizations can access resources and workloads from different cloud providers and/or platforms. Now in terms of some of those providers some of the significant or more common ones that you might be familiar with already are Apache, which is part of Citrix, has what's known as CloudStack, Amazon Web Services API and Eucalyptus, Google Compute Engine, Simple Cloud, OpenStack API, VMware vCloud API, and finally Microsoft Azure. So these are all the providers and they all have their different interfaces and APIs that are dedicated to allow to configure and construct all of the necessary components, whatever it is you need in your cloud environment.

### Web Standards
[Video description begins] Topic title: Web Standards. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
When it comes to web standards, there are some that are cloud related, but again not specifically geared toward any particular type of cloud services. But there are a number of organizations that are trying to maintain these standards for things like application compatibility and just overall development standards to make sure that the applications that they're offering are compatible and easily accessed by just about any device. So again, not specifically targeted at cloud services, but it's the kind of thing that you would want to know. Does your cloud service provider adhere to the standards of these organizations? So some of them include the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, and this was established to develop agreement across the industry and among vendors. They strive to develop these open specifications or standards to enhance and improve vendor-product interoperability when it comes to any kind of web-related product. So things like HTML and HTML5, but basically just universal HTML markup specifications as well as Cascading Style Sheets 3, which is adopting a universal stylesheet specification. So you know, again, by adhering to these standards, you increase the interoperability and ease of access from various types of devices.

There's also the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group. This is primarily focused on HTML5. And then we also have the European Computer Manufacturers Association. So they all work in different areas, but they strive to produce these standards, again, to simply ensure that all of the different web applications that are being released are very compatible with each other and, again supported by accessing it from just about anything. So the W3C, their primary focus is to develop these de facto standards in the following areas: Web Design and Applications; Web of Devices, so again the physical device you are using; Web Architecture; Web of Services; and XML Technology or the Extensible Markup Language. And the ECMA standards are focused on standardizing JavaScript. So you know, again it's just something that you would like to see from your service provider that they do meet the standards of these organizations.

Now typically within the W3C, as far as their web design and applications area of interest goes what you'll typically find there are specifications that are applicable to HTML, the Hypertext Markup Language itself; Cascading Style Sheets; JavaScript APIs, numerous specifications for those. And, of course, different types of graphics: PNG, SVG, CSS, Canvas APIs, and WebCGM. So all again, just trying to make these standardized approaches to design your web-based application. XML technology is certainly something that's a lot more common these days and maybe it was going back to, say, maybe 10 years ago. And the whole idea behind XML is to describe or structure the content of any kind of information. So hence, the term extensible. It is designed to be further developed. You typically see XML used a lot in conjunction with database applications and that's only one example. But the idea is, again, to be able to structure data by using tags that aren't standard. HTML has a set of standard tags. XML can effectively have anything as a tag as long as it describes the structure of data.

So XML, XSLT, XPath, XQuery, these are all different mechanisms to be able to structure, and extract, and query information from various types of technologies. XML Security, data integrity, authentication, and privacy can all be undertaken with XML. So, you know, again W3C is simply trying to standardize these approaches. And Web of Services typically involves things like Encryption; XML Signatures; X-Key Management Specifications or Standards; Messaging, Simple Object Access Protocol Applications; and various Web Payment Interest Group. And you see there is a URL for how to deal with accepting payments. So not only do you want to know that your service provider [Video description begins] The URL for Web Payment Interests Group is HTTP://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/ [Video description ends] itself is adhering to these standards, but you want to know that they're supported should you want to be developing applications that are web-based using their cloud environment. Most of them are, of course, but it's definitely something you want to know is fully supported by your service provider.

### Open Source Overview
[Video description begins] Topic title: Open Source Overview. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
Open source is probably a term that you've heard before and the idea behind it is that various open source software and applications allow you to develop your own cloud platform using free software applications and development tools. Now this is always been the case with open source, it effectively means that it is not owned by any particular person or entity, rather it is just something that's maintained by a community of developers, so that there's effectively no one to pay if you even wanted to. Nobody has license on this particular application, or utility, or whatever it is. And this is something that's been ongoing for a long time. And many of the larger corporations do use open source as an alternative to using a software house or a specific vendor because, of course, it is free. Now you might think that along with that, you know, there's very little control if nobody manages it or owns it. It could be difficult, but, in fact, open source cloud development tools are well supported, well organized, and usually have an aggressive, or in this case, very controlled, and very monitored, and fully tested, versioning and release cycle. So it does still have to go through a process, if you will, before any particular application can achieve a new version and/or a new release.

So in the case of the cloud, in fact the open source route existed before any kind of software houses offered these expensive alternatives. So you have the choice now. But the open source route has been around, in fact, since the beginning of cloud-based services. So there could be a number of reasons to adopt an open source development route and most notably the cost effectiveness of it. It is essentially free. There really is nothing to purchase when you go the open source route. You still have to pay your developers, of course, but it is much more cost effective. There is no licensing. Minimum entry barrier, you know, again there's just nothing that you have to purchase. There are no prerequisites that you need to have in place and the support is in fact there via a large user community group as well as a large developer group. So not only do you have the developers in a community, you have all the users. So there is a lot of support for any given application. Again, the aggressive versioning or release cycle and the transparent code base are available to anyone. Anyone can get in there and look at it. In terms of support or troubleshooting, you can get the code from others, things like that.

It is very modern, literally up to the minute, so that if something is in the works, you know, that's very new, you can find out about that and you can get that code base pretty much immediately. So the open standards creators work well with the open source developers to maintain this community, and maintain the support, maintain these releases, and all of that. So it is definitely something that you might want to consider when adopting a cloud model. Some of the open source tools and APIs that are available: Open Source Cloud Appliances; Open Source Computing Clouds; Cloud Storage Software; Configuration Management Tools; Hypervisors; NoSQL Databases and these are the unstructured, unrelated, just tabular storage with no connection to any other tables; Platform as a Service; Provisioning Tools; and Software Defined Networking Tools. So these are just categories, but all of these are available in open source versions as opposed to purchasing or licensing a vendor-specific version.

Some open source cloud services projects including Storage as a Service are listed here: OpenNebula, OpenStack, Apache CloudStack, and HP Helion Eucalyptus. And there are all the URLs there, of course, but it's definitely [Video description begins] The URL for OpenNebula is HTTP://opennebula.org/ . The URL for OpenStack is HTTP://cloudstack.apache.org/ . The URL for Apache CloudStack is HTTP://cloudstack.apache.org/ . The URL for HP Helion Eucalyptus is HTTPs://www.eucaIyptus.com/ [Video description ends] something that you would want to research and look into for those benefits mentioned and for possibly just ease of implementation. The support that's available and, of course, the effectively zero cost associated with open source.

### Open Source Cloud and N-Tier Architecture
[Video description begins] Topic title: Open Source Cloud and N-Tier Architecture. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
With respect then to open source and mobile cloud services, looking at some of the N-Tier architecture, which just means an unknown amount of tiers. In essence, it refers to the three divided layers that are differentiated by the level of abstraction they present to the service customers and they are IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service, PaaS - Platform as a Service, and SaaS - Software as a Service. Now within each one of these open source and/or mobile cloud development is entirely supportive. So within IaaS, this also incorporates STaaS, or Storage as a Service, and supports activity in the other layers. Infrastructure is typically the base or the foundation if you will. Other things are built upon the infrastructure. Platform as a Service provide services to deploy a test, host, and maintain various applications. And Software as a Service incorporates the highest level, wherein the abstraction is more or less for the applications that run browsers and where data is hosted in the cloud.

So looking a little more closely at each of those the IaaS layer or Infrastructure as a Service provides access to the computing resources in a virtualized environment. So this is where we start to build our platforms, the data centers. This is where we host our web sites. The resources include private virtual server space and storage space, network connections and private or virtualized local area networks, private and public IP addresses, load balancers, things like this that are all the necessary foundation equipment to be able to implement really anything. The characteristics include elastic or flexible provisioning, self-service interface and support. You can create a new virtual machine, for example, anytime you want. Security, there is authentication and data integrity and typically a 100% uptime because of the fault tolerance that they have for their resources. So again, when it comes to open source and/or mobile cloud development, your IaaS is basically where everything starts and you could absolutely use open source solutions for this.

Some of the benefits to providers and consumers: Scalability, for sure, capacity expansion is quick and there's no wastage of any unused capacity. No upfront investment in hardware and that could be huge to a lot of organizations. You are simply subscribing to the resources of the provider so you in essence don't have to acquire anything. Utility style costing...in other words you only pay for what you use. There's typically no flat rate that you have to pay no matter what. In most cases, it is a "pay as you go". Location independence...it doesn't matter where you are. It doesn't matter where they are as long as you have Internet connectivity, you have access to your service. Physical security of data center locations... usually the providers are quite diligent on their own security because, of course, they have to pass that on to their customers. And in terms of the security the provider manages that as well as the data integrity. So you offload that responsibility from your organization onto the provider and they typically do not have a single point of failure. In a lot of cases, right down to the entire data center, they could lose an entire data center. There is usually another one available to assume services.

Now Platform as a Service, this provides cloud-located platforms and development environments to allow application developers to build web and desktop applications and services. So the idea, again is that you don't have to create your own development lab. You can simply subscribe to the cloud service provider's environment. This fully supports testing and deployment, and the characteristics include development tools that are constantly upgraded. Again particularly with the open source environment, you always have access to the latest releases of the applications and the customer can select whatever required tools that they want. The services are provided, again on a subscription basis, so you only pay for what you use and there's usually a very wide selection of the available applications, both vendor specific and open source. PaaS offerings typically include the operating systems, server-side scripting environments, database management, and system, such as SQL databases, design, and development tools, support, storage, network access. For example, Microsoft's Azure includes the Microsoft Developer Network and Visual Studio Online. So again, you would not need to purchase either of those. You would not need an MSDN subscription nor would you have to purchase Visual Studio. You can simply take advantage of the provider's environment that already includes it.

Benefits to the providers and the consumers...again no upfront investment in hardware or infrastructure. No software licensing costs. Utility style costing is still in place. You only pay for what you use. A very adaptable environment, easy to change, very flexible. Team Development...there are centralized development environments and you can include all kinds of version control software as well. And security...the provider manages the security and the data integrity. So again, you offload that from your own environment. And finally, Software as a Service...this is a cloud service where consumers access software applications on the Internet. Things such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, so on, those are examples of Software as a Service. And Software as a Service Applications are often rented on a per-user or per-usage basis, and various SaaS products are supported by IaaS, the Infrastructure, and then can be created or developed using PaaS. So the infrastructure supports the development level of platform and then platform is where you develop the software. So you just basically build up from each level for these various applications.

And again, the benefits to your providers and consumers, minimized hardware costs. The processing power required to run the application is provided from the cloud environment and all of their hardware. Minimal setup costs, simply subscribe and learn. Again, pay for what you use; flexible usage plans; consumer controlled. Scalable usage...you can increase the amount at any time. Automated updates of applications usually free of charge. Mobility...application can be accessed as long as you have Internet access by any Internet-enabled device from anywhere and Application branding if desired. Some applications can be branded. So again, a number of benefits at each level or each tier of the cloud architecture using open source models.

### OpenStack Overview
[Video description begins] Topic title: OpenStack Overview. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
OpenStack is an open-source cloud computing software platform available since 2010 now managed by the OpenStack Foundation, which was established in 2012 and it's deployed to create private and public clouds. So if you as a provider are looking to make cloud services available to anyone, either privately or publicly, you can take this OpenStack approach. So we see from the OpenStack web site, and we'll see their URL coming up in a moment, "OpenStack software controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a data center, managed through a dashboard, or via the OpenStack API. Works with popular enterprise and open source technologies making it ideal for heterogeneous infrastructure. " So the whole idea, again, is that if you want to provide services to anyone, you can take this open-source approach. And again, the benefits of open source...there's no licensing fees. It's fully supported by just about anything in very large communities of users and developers to support it.

Now as far as the architecture and the components go, it's primarily developed using Python. OpenStack provides an IaaS solution, Infrastructure as a Service, via a set of interrelated services. So each service offers an API that facilitates this integration. Users can access OpenStack via the web-based user interface implemented by the Dashboard service or via command line clients and by issuing API request. As of the time of this recording, the latest release is OpenStack Kilo, the 11th release, which was put out in April 2015. So the idea then is that you can create and manage computing resources and infrastructure, networking resources and infrastructure, and storage resources and infrastructure. So with this, you have the machines for your compute resources, [Video description begins] A diagram showing OpenStack architecture and component parts displays. Within OpenStack Shared Services there are sections for Storage, Networking and Compute. OpenStack Shared Services is connected to Your Application and the OpenStack dashboard. [Video description ends] the networks for networking, and drives and volumes for storage.

So your application basically is simply accessing those resources and you can configure all of it through the OpenStack dashboard. So again, this is from the perspective of a customer, they would see the OpenStack dashboard. They are then going to use your applications, so that they can configure the necessary compute networking and storage resources. Now as far as the services go, you see there are quite a few here, [Video description begins] The table for OpenStack services contains 11 rows and the following 3 columns: Service, Project name and Description. For Service Dashboard, Project name is Horizon, and Description is Provides a web-based self-service portal to interact with underlying OpenStack services, such as launching an instance, assigning IP addresses and configuring access controls. For Service Compute, Project name is Nova, and Description is Manages the lifecycle of compute instances in an OpenStack environment. Responsibilities include spawning, scheduling, and decommissioning of virtual machines on demand. For Service Networking, Project name is Neutron, and Description is Enables Network-Connectivity-as-a-Service for other OpenStack services, such as OpenStack compute. Provides an API for users to define networks and the attachments in to them. Has a pluggable architecture that supports many popular networking vendors and technology. For Service Object Storage, Project name is Swift, and Description is Stores and retrieves arbitrary unstructured data objects via a RESTful, HTTP-based API. It is highly fault tolerant with its data replication and scale-out architecture. Its implementation is not like a file server with mountable directories. In this case, it writes objects and files to multiple drives, ensuring the data is replicated across a server cluster. For Service Block Storage, Project name is Cinder, and Description is Provides persistent block storage to running instances. Its pluggable drives architecture facilitates the creation and management of block storage devices. [Video description ends] too much detail to go through in this slide, but you do see a breakdown of which service is available. The project name and a basic description of what it's all about. So, you know, just quickly, for example, we see the Dashboard; Project name: Horizon, "Provides a web-based self-service portal to interact with the underlying OpenStack services, such as launching an instance, assigning an IP address and configuring access controls. " So depending on what it is that you need, you simply choose the appropriate service and find out effectively how you can configure that particular service through which types of interfaces or APIs and you see the description there for all of them. So they do offer a number of services and effectively how you can get in and configure that service.

[Video description begins] For Service Identity Service, Project name is Keystone, and Description is Provides an authentication and authorization service for other OpenStack services. Provides a catalog of endpoints for all OpenStack services. For Service Image Service, Project name is Glance, and Description is Stores and retrieves virtual machine disk images. OpenStack Compute makes use of this during instance provisioning. For Service Telemetry, Project name is Ceilometer, and Description is Monitors and meters the OpenStack cloud for billing, benchmarking, scalability, and statistical purposes. For Service Orchestration, Project name is Heat, and Description is Orchestrates multiple composite cloud applications by using either the native HOT template format or the AWS CloudFormation template format, through both an OpenStack-native REST API and a CloudFormation-compatible Query API. For Service Database service, Project name is Trove, and Description is Provides scalable and reliable Cloud Database-as-a-Service functionality for both relational and non-relational database engines. For Service Data processing service, Project name is Sahara, and Description is Provides capabilities to provision and scale Hadoop clusters in OpenStack by specifying parameters like Hadoop version, cluster topology, and nodes hardware details. [Video description ends]

Now as far as the deployment models go, you know, this is up to you, but there is an OpenStack-based public cloud, wherein a third party vendor provides a public cloud-computing system based on the OpenStack project. So you can make it available to anyone in the public Internet. There's also on-premises distribution, wherein a customer downloads and installs an OpenStack distribution within their internal network so they can use the same kind of resources and applications to control their own internal environment. A hosted OpenStack private cloud...the vendor host an OpenStack-based private cloud incorporating the underlying hardware and the OpenStack software. But the idea again behind the private cloud is that you may be have a centralized data center and then your separate departments or divisions are accessing the services of your corporate headquarters, we'll call it, through the OpenStack APIs and various services.

OpenStack as a Service...the vendor hosts OpenStack management software, but without any hardware as a service. In this deployment, customers rent the service and then integrate it with their internal servers, storage, and networks to get a fully operational private cloud. So you already have the hardware. You are looking to create a private cloud for your branches, your divisions, your departments. You can just use the OpenStack as a Service as a management software to control the allocation of that hardware. So again, OpenStack is managed by a non-profit foundation and you see there is the URL there and it's comprised of a board of directors, [Video description begins] The URL for OpenStack non-profit foundation is HTTP://www.openstack.org/foundation/ [Video description ends] a technical committee, and a user committee. And at present, again at the time of this recording, there are 13 total members that are elected by active tech contributors. But you can always go and check that web site out to get more information about how to implement the OpenStack services. [Video description begins] The URL for the OpenStack web site is HTTP://www.openstack.org/ [Video description ends]

### Mobile Cloud Clients
[Video description begins] Topic title: Mobile Cloud Clients. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
As we're all very aware the world is becoming more and more mobile every day. So Mobile Cloud Computing, or MCC, is something that is becoming much more common and much more in demand. And it simply integrates cloud computing into the mobile device environment. It uses a combination of technologies all of the cloud computing standard resources and services, the mobile device itself, Ethernet, wireless networking, et cetera, and provides our mobile clients with access to cloud-hosted services and applications and even things like Storage as a Service. So the whole idea at its simplest here you see, it refers to an infrastructure, where both the data storage and the data processing happen outside of the mobile device. In other words, we don't want all this data and all this processing happening on the device itself. Mobile cloud applications move the computing power and the data storage away from the mobile phone and into the cloud bringing applications and mobile computing to not just smartphone users, but a much broader range of mobile subscribers.

So in terms of the future, MCC is developing as the next generation's computing infrastructure. And at its core, it offers the same advantage as any other cloud services, it's permitting users to access the infrastructure, such as servers, network, and storage from a cloud service provider. It gives us a platform, middleware services and operating systems to work with, and, of course, software to use such as any kind of application program. But MCC will support business opportunities for mobile network operators as well as cloud service providers. So it's obviously, as the name suggests, an extension, the ability to include all of our mobile users in this cloud type of environment. So this is just a bit of a diagram as to the architecture. So we see, of course, the mobile devices themselves whatever they are. [Video description begins] A diagram of the architecture of Mobile Cloud Clients displays. The diagram contains a Mobile Network A, Mobile Devices, Internet and Cloud Services and how they are connected. The Mobile Network A comprises an icon representing Servers connected to Database, Central Processors, HA, and AAA. The icon for Central Processors is connected to Satellite, Access Point, and BTS. Three Mobile Devices are connected to Mobile Network A. The Mobile Network A and the Mobile Devices are together connected to the Cloud Services present inside the Internet cloud. [Video description ends] They are going to connect into their own home network using whatever type of service either satellite and access point or what's known as a base transceiver station, typically standard cellular service, for example, but they connect usually into some kind of remote access server, where their request for resource is processed. And this gives them access to things like the servers and databases, for example. The HA there is what's known as a Home Agent and this just typically identifies what their home network location is in reference to where they might be now because you can set restrictions on what they're able to access from where.

So you can determine whether or not they might be in a home location, such as one of your branch offices, and AAA refers to Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting. Now accounting in this respect is what are they accessing? What kind of time are they spending with this particular connection, things like that? So this allows them to simply access their own network first, but then that, of course, is connected through to the cloud services via the Internet. They can effectively then call it proxy, if you will, through that to access the cloud services. Now as far as the MCC objective it's to manage and overcome some of the technical mobile computing related obstacles. So they include things like performance. For example battery life, being able to push the processing to off-device processors will absolutely increase the battery life of that device. Same idea with storage, if we push the storage up to the cloud locations, then we don't have nearly as much storage to maintain because mobile devices don't have all that much available.

We can lower the bandwidth. The overall environment becomes much more heterogeneous, very scalable, and highly available. So we have increased reliability and better Quality of Service. There are always security and trust issues because mobile devices are of course, much more susceptible to being lost and stolen so that's always a challenge; along with that privacy and data integrity making sure that only the appropriate people are gaining access to the appropriate data. So those are all challenges that are faced by mobile cloud clients. So some of the advantages then of perhaps moving to mobile cloud computing do get you hopefully that extended mobile battery life time. Again, by offloading the processing to cloud-based servers you can increase your battery life. Your improved data storage capacity is absolutely a huge advantage. Again, like a mobile phone, for example, I would only have something like 8 GB of storage. Storage in the cloud is unlimited so you can access a lot more information; improve data reliability, integrity, and safety because, again, the cloud service providers offer huge amounts of redundancy and safety features for the data storage.

Efficient processing and improved power preservation... so again coming back to the extended battery life, but simply because of less processing happening on the device itself. Dynamic provisioning of resources like any cloud service, it is very flexible. Any new service can come and go very easily. The saleability of service is, not scalability, to sell the service a lot more easily because of these advantages and multitenancy from a provider perspective. You can, of course, support many different customers. That's the idea behind multitenancy. With respect to some of the development that we're seeing... mobile cloud computing application and services development, it's proceeding at pace in the following areas; mobile commerce or m-commerce; mobile learning or m-learning; mobile healthcare...health monitoring and emergency services/health-aware devices, a lot of applications these days have these health-based applications on them; mobile gaming, of course, social networking and transport services, such as taxi and things like that. So a lot of new applications that are coming along all the time, but definitely some very useful features that are in development with mobile cloud services.

### Exercise: Managing Storage, Governance and Standards
[Video description begins] Topic title: Exercise: Managing Storage, Governance and Standards. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
Now for a practice, what we would like you to do is to effectively formulate a proposed solution given a scenario using what has been addressed in this course. Now there really is no correct answer, there are so many different possibilities that we just like you to look through the scenario, go through each of the steps, and see if you can apply what you've learned to each of those steps. So we won't bother with any kind of comparison to your answer with ours because there are just too many possibilities. But the idea is to simply see if you can apply some of the material that has been learned to a fictitious scenario. And the scenario is your company is considering wide spread use of a storage as a service to host all corporate documentation with particular emphasis on system governance and standards. What available guidance and what established standards and protocols would have to be applied in the following process. So go ahead and pause this video and list out the steps. When you're done, resume the video and I'll go through the steps in a bit more detail.

So what we see first of all is due diligence on a number of providers and how they comply with the available guidance and standards regarding data security, physical security of the data locations, and certifications that have been attained. Then some due diligence of the provider's storage as a service security, authentication, trust, privacy, isolation, things like that. And then some due diligence of the provider's service; system elasticity, file access, backup and recovery, business continuity, service level agreements, synchronization, sharing, versioning, et cetera. Then some cost analysis of potential services and selective provider. Then select a prototype department for testing, develop and adopt document classification methodology, then apply in test. Integrate the cloud document management with your existing local storage system.

Roll it out to a single department and test for a known period. Train the staff, adapt and change as required during the testing. And then while step 6 is in progress, classify the balance of the company documentation and develop the tiered document management architecture, folder structures, and access rights. Train the company, of course, and then roll out company wide. So again there are just too many possibilities here, but the idea is to simply apply some of the governance and standard protocols and methodologies to this particular scenario and see if you can match up each of those with each particular step.

### Storage as a Service
[Video description begins] Topic title: Storage as a Service. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
Taking a look now at cloud storage overview, or Storage as a Service, or STaaS, this is a business model wherein a third-party provider offers space on their storage system to end users. Now that's not anything particularly new in terms of cloud services, many cloud service providers do offer storage but this model is more so dedicated to just storage or at least focused on it. So the space that's provided can be free and/or rented and this depends, of course, on the model, the various platforms, or tiers that are available, and whether or not it's a public or a private service. But this is usually classified as a component of IaaS, which is Infrastructure as a Service because, of course, this is something that ultimately is required. There is always some kind of storage that is necessary in a cloud service in most cases. So Storage as a Service supports the offsite storage and backup of data and files using the Internet as a transfer/synchronization media. And this is something that is very often required in a lot of organizations. It is necessary for them to store a copy of maybe their backups on some sort of offsite location. So if they lose their entire physical location due to a natural disaster, for example, they still have a copy of that data somewhere else.

So STaaS providers offer various levels of file management and file protection mechanisms depending, of course, on the provider and as mentioned, the package or the tier that you might subscribe to. But the providers offer various service options as well that are, of course, targeted at the specific client requirements. And it can be offered as either a public service, or maybe just internally within a corporation as part of a private service and that might be something you would see in a private cloud environment, again, wherein something like a corporate headquarters provides all the storage for all of the branch locations, for example. So files are transferred to and from via a local computer application interface or by simply dragging and dropping files to and from what appears to be a local drive and folder structure on the client file management system. And some of you might be familiar with this already even if you are not entirely certain that that is exactly what's happening. If you've signed up with a public space provider, a lot of times they'll create a folder on your own local computer. And all you have to do to get the data up to the cloud-based location is just drop it into a folder that appears to be local on your computer. That content is then synchronized with the cloud-based copy.

So file synchronization allows these targeted folders and files to be automatically backed up and synchronized without any user intervention. Again, you just place it into the folder, forget about it, walk away, it will upload and it will synchronize. And you can also implement encryption, which of course, allows the files to be protected at the cloud location so that they are also secure. Now available access feature allows the clients to access the files from any location and, of course, that's one of the huge benefits of all cloud services, it does not matter where you are. As long as you have Internet connectivity, you can, of course, then gain access to your files. So with that, not only are you able to access it from any location but also from any kind of device, whether it would be laptop, mobile phone, tablet, anything along those lines, they can all access that data.

Now just with respect to storage versus backup, just in terms of clarifying the two terms because a provider may actually offer them both. Backup implies some kind of file versioning and an automatic upload, so something that's usually managed in an automatic fashion. And you might have a copy from yesterday, a copy from a week ago, a copy from two weeks ago, a copy from a month ago, so those various versions basically are what they refer to when it comes to backup. Storage simply implies the ability to transfer the file, possibly share it, synchronize it, but not necessarily having these multiple redundant copies of the file. So again, the provider may offer both and you have to make sure that you are subscribing to the correct service, of course. So now depending on the provider, the following STaaS service features are generally available. So there are a number of them and you, of course, can pick and choose what you need. But in almost all cases, you'll find file backup and/or synchronization available. This is again usually automated but still configurable but can also be done manually at any point in time. So along with file backup, you might also see an open file backup feature for things like databases that need to remain online while they are being backed up.

File sharing is a collaboration feature where multiple users can have input to a particular file. And file versioning is that storage of multiple versions. So if you need to track the changes that have happened to a file, that's basically what's known as versioning. File view and edit from the cloud version, so you can actually open up and make changes to the version that is up in the cloud, it's not just a read-only copy. File security, as to who can access it and, of course, do what with any given file. File encryption services might be available, content access protection, including transfer encryption. So while it's being uploaded or synchronized, that process is also encrypted for additional security. File safety, no file loss so you know that the file is always going to be there so they have multiple redundant copies. File archiving, where it's just something that you want to store up there and just simply make sure that it is available. This is essentially backups but they usually don't change, it's just a copy that we just want to keep, it's not going to change, just keep it up there for however long.

Flexible, elastic, storage capacity options, so you know, just simply flexibility in terms of what you have, you don't want to be rigidly stuck in a contract example that never allows for growth. Professional and always available technical support, things like live chat, e-mail, ticket system, anything along those lines and, of course, a well-developed and end user-targeted service level agreement that includes usually a minimum of 99.99% up time. So this provides very high data and file resiliency and availability. And basically that's, you know, getting into the point where it's only a few hours per year, where there is downtime. Now that might be, of course, for things like schedule maintenance, which is usually acceptable as well. But those are all of the types of services that you might encounter with any kind of storage provider and you just want to make sure that you're getting what you need and that they are providing all of the features that you require for your solution.

### STaaS Model Advantages
[Video description begins] Topic title: STaaS Model Advantages. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
There are number of Storage as a Service model advantages and benefits including data/file access anywhere. As long as you have access to the Internet, you have access to your information and, of course, the Internet is 24x7, 365 so not only can it be anywhere, but anytime as well. And also from any type of device whether it's your desktop system at work, or a tablet, or a phone while travelling, it doesn't matter. As long as the application you are using supports accessing the information, you can gain access to it from anything, anywhere, anytime. For most organizations, it will reduce the hardware and the hardware support cost because you no longer have to layout the funds to purchase all of the equipment for that storage, you simply subscribe and you pay as you go, so this typically reduces the cost. And it provides and/or supports tremendous scalability for all intents and purposes you can get as much storage as you need and just grow, and grow, and grow, for whatever requirements you have.

So this provides, you know, low-cost storage, backup, possibly primary storage, and even disaster recovery solutions simply because of the fact that you have another copy of the data outside of your own organization. And that might even meet some legal requirements for offsite storage. A lot of organizations are required by law to maintain a copy of their data in a site other than their own. We'll typically minimize user intervention as well for these types of processes end users for the most part just access the data from what appears to be a local folder on their system so they manage their data like any other file. Data and file synchronization is another feature that's usually available. And the idea behind this is that a user simply works with a local copy of a file they make changes to it, place it into the synchronization folder, and whatever changes they made are synchronized with the cloud-based copy so they are always kept consistent. And you can also enable file sharing so that other users are able to gain access to that file. And then you can typically configure, of course, who can access it and what they can do with it in terms of whether or not they can just read it or make changes as well.

You can control the security of the file in the cloud location. You want to make sure that that copy is kept secure so most providers will offer data and file encryption to enhance the security of that file. And you can also control the security with respect to the device in the event wherein the drive is stolen, or it's lost or it just fails. In most cases, you can control access by device so that if it's stolen, for example, you can block that device from being able to access the data. There is always up to date support for the hardware and software. And the nice feature about this is that it is no longer your concern to maintain and upgrade everything that's involved. It's the responsibility of the provider to make sure everything is up to date. So you alleviate that from your organization. You can enhance the security with respect to local portable devices; most of them offer the support for authentication these days. So in other words, you can ensure that only the appropriate person is accessing the data through the appropriate device through various authentication means.

And for smaller organizations or start-ups, this is very attractive because there is limited upfront and growth associated cost base involved with Storage as a Service. You don't have to go out and buy all kinds of physical infrastructure equipment to support your storage needs, you simply pay for the subscription so this is usually a lot less expensive. It offers backup solutions alongside traditional storage options in other words, you can still maintain your current backup infrastructure. But you can augment or supplement it with additional backups that are configured with the cloud. And finally, a Quasi-centralized control of your data/files. Now the term Quasi in this case refers to the fact that your management of the data is centralized, you can use a single application or a single management console, but the location is not so much under your control because it is, of course, at the end of the day stored in a data center at the provider. So you don't have control over the location, but you do have centralized control over the management. So again, a number of advantages to using Storage as a Service.

### STaaS Model Risks
[Video description begins] Topic title: STaaS Model Risks. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
Now there are a few disadvantages and risks to the Storage as a Service model and you need to be aware of these when assessing this option. And for starters, there are trust and privacy issues because, of course, the data is not physically under your control in terms of its location. It resides in a data center at the provider location. So whether or not you feel that that's adequate is certainly your call, but in some cases, it's not even permitted so you need to be aware of that. But of course, you are placing your trust in the provider to maintain security and the privacy of that data. But one of the other issues is that the data centers, all of the hardware, and the resources that you are using are ultimately shared by other customers as well. So you need some pretty high assurances that the data is protected. It is kept private and that there aren't any issues with storing it with the provider. Security, of course, there are shared file access and encryption features that are both supported. So you need to make sure that it's very clear as to who is able to gain access to files and whether or not there are encryption mechanisms in place to enhance the security of that information.

Reliability and, you know...these are the kinds of things that you expect to see in a service level agreement in terms of the percentage of uptime. So you simply want to keep an eye out for the highest service level agreement possible. The speed certainly can be slower than local saves, backups, and/or retrievals because, of course, you are using the Internet to transfer the files back and forth from your location up to the cloud. And that in and of itself might be one of the largest risks simply not having access to the Internet at all. You are entirely dependent on Internet connections when you move to any kind of cloud-based services, so a loss of connectivity means loss of services from the provider as well. Document control issues, another thing you need to be aware of. A lot of environments these days might implement some kind of versioning control or possibly security features such as rights, management access who can do what with a document. So it needs to be very clear as to what is supported and some of those features may not be supported in a Storage as a Service model.

High initial bandwidth usage and, of course, ongoing costs in terms of bandwidth for very large files, if you do start to implement a lot of large files in the cloud, then you certainly are going to pay for that because the more you use the more you pay. So keeping your cost control at a manageable level is always a challenge and then, of course, the recurring costs every month. It might provide a good cost effective solution originally, but then as things start to grow, you might find your cost is growing along with that. Potential data ownership issues, because you are existing in a shared environment and there can be multiple users accessing a particular document, it can become a little bit convoluted as to who actually owns the original data itself. And provider lock-in issues, wherein this is a situation that might arise if you decide you want to move to a new technology of some kind. But the proprietary hardware, or services, or software that's in place by the provider don't support moving to this new technology so you end up being locked in to a particular technology or solution. So those are all things, again, that you need to be aware of and you certainly need to consider before moving to a Storage as a Service model.

### STaaS Providers
[Video description begins] Topic title: STaaS Providers. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
Let's have a look then at some of the Storage as a Service providers and some of the features that you would want to consider when trying to determine which provider you should go with. So things like the accessibility of the data and files, how easily are they accessed and from where, so things like your mobile users and, of course, from which devices and which applications. So overall, accessibility of the information and, hand in hand with that, the flexibility of it. So does it support cross-platform use or different operating systems, maybe different applications that are still accessing the same information? You know, all of those variances. So how easily accessible is it and how flexible is it? The data/file security, of course, any access control mechanisms that are in place, backups, business continuity, so fault tolerance, reliability, availability, things like that.

And there are a number of popular offerings for individual users. So you might also want to compare and examine the business-targeted providers for larger-scale operations. So you know, it's not something that's just targeted toward business. There are a lot of individual users that do take advantage of Storage as a Service, and actually we'll see some of those in a moment. But do they offer things like synchronization or sharing and mobile device access and/or multiple device access? So you know, it's always a matter of understanding what your needs are and, of course, whether or not the provider can meet those needs. Now some other options that you would want to consider, whether or not they have just storage and backup or storage and backup as part of a larger platform. So maybe database storage and the security that we spoke of, sharing synchronization to all those other things. So storage and backup, it's just a part of a larger solution. And/or of course, a hybrid wherein you simply have a little bit of this, a little bit of that. So always just knowing what the provider is offering is part of their solution.

So here are a few examples of providers. Google Drive, free, 15 gigs of rented space that is available, and they do support synchronization and sharing. And as of the time of this recording, the URLs that you'll see here are still accurate, but they may possibly change. Dropbox, free, two gigabytes of rented space, and home and business options, also supporting synchronization and sharing. OneDrive from Microsoft, up to 15 gigs of rented space, Office 365 subscribers get one terabyte, and synchronization and sharing also supported. JustCloud just has a free trial, and you basically determine from that whether or not you want to continue your service. All devices are supported. Synchronization and sharing is available. Amazon Cloud Drive, again free five gigs of rented space. Synchronization is supported. IBM Storage System for Cloud, they offer a free trial, and again you can just decide from that point whether or not the service meets your needs. SugarSync, another free trial with rented space, synchronization and sharing supported. And OpenDrive, free five gigs of rented space, synchronization and sharing supported.

Now most of those offer different packages, of course, for maybe an individual user versus the business. So you do certainly want to just get in there, have a look, see what their service offerings are, and then try to compare them to determine which one will best suit your needs. But there is a comparison site, if you will, that is available, again at least at the time of this recording. You see here some storage comparison awards for 2015. That URL right there provides you with a comparison chart, [Video description begins] The URL for the Storage Comparison Awards 2015 is as follows: https://www.cloudwards.net/comparison/. [Video description ends] all of the features, a user rating, Storage &amp; Pricing, all of the plans available, and the features that are included within that. So that gives you a good breakdown of all of them, and you can very easily see which feature set might best suit your needs and, of course, what the cost is if you do require something over and above the free trials or the basic plans that do have a certain amount of free space included. So a lot of things to consider, but hopefully resources like that and a little bit of research will help you determine which kind of package, which provider will best suit your needs.

### Cloud Storage Governance Domains
[Video description begins] Topic title: Cloud Storage Governance Domains. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson [Video description ends]
Any type of organization or even individual that might be considering a move to any kind of cloud service is going to want to feel comfortable, and assured, and secure in the provider in that they are able to meet the needs of the organization or that individual. So to assist in this, there is an organization known as the Cloud Security Alliance, or CSA, and this is an organization that was founded in 2008. It's a nonprofit and it's supported by numerous working groups. And the idea is to promote security, regulatory awareness, and system requirements within the cloud-based computing environment and/or community. So what they do is to publish this security guidance for critical areas of focus in cloud computing. The current version is Version 3 released in November of 2011, and it acts as a guide to potential service users and educates and promotes the awareness of the key issues involved in cloud-based solutions. So the CSA supports both the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, as well as the European Union via the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security, also known as ENISA.

So what happens with this is that they have the security guidance for critical areas of focus in the cloud computing guide as mentioned. This breaks it down. It consists of three areas of interest relating to cloud computing, and each area is defined as what's known as a domain. The latest version identifies 14 different domains, but they're grouped into three different sections. And Section 1 is simply Cloud Architecture. Section 2 is Governing in the Cloud, and Section 3 is Operating in the Cloud. So within that, you'll find each of these domains, which, if you will, are sort of the subtopics, different areas of focus within architecture, within governing, within operating. But they're all in there and they're simply just categorized. So within the guidance document, the CSA provides recommendations and requirements as they apply to each domain to service users investigating the potential use of a cloud service, and you can find the entire guide at the URL listed right there as of the time of this recording.

Now specifically Domain 5, this is Information Management and Data Security. [Video description begins] The CSA Security Guidance can be found at the following link: https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/guidance. [Video description ends] So this is typically something that organizations that are looking at Storage as a Service would be interested in. The service consumers should develop an understanding of the provider's STaaS system capabilities in the following key areas. So the provider's storage management capabilities; data search and analysis capabilities of the provider's system; migration support options and capabilities; and backup function capabilities as well; and continuing on...archiving capabilities and archive access, both short and long term; data and file storage mechanisms at the service provider, encryption standard applied to various technologies; DAM and FAM, which is Data Activity Monitoring and File Activity Monitoring, for the user-level access and auditing of who has been able to do what.

And of course, trust in terms of the certificates that might be used and the credentials that are being used to access this information. So all of those apply to that life cycle that you see there in terms of the data where it is created, it's stored, it's used, shared possibly, archived, and ultimately destroyed. So for that entire life cycle of data, you want to know what the provider's capabilities are in terms of handling each component, each phase in that life cycle. Domain 3 addresses legal issues, and again this is certainly a concern for a lot of environments. This discusses the implications for data and document storage, [Video description begins] Domain 3 also concerns Contract and Electronic Discovery. [Video description ends] possibly intra-country, or state, and even internationally, and discusses the legal issues that may arise in connection with personal data and file transfers to and from the cloud, and/or possibly across international boundaries.

And again this, in some cases, completely prohibits certain organizations from using cloud services because they simply cannot store data outside of their own organization. So you need to be aware of whether or not this affects you and, if so, in what manner. So Domain 3 covers all of that. So ultimately, the advice always promotes due diligence, so always do your homework basically. It specifically states, "Before entering into a cloud computing arrangement, a company should evaluate its own practices, needs, and restrictions in order to identify the legal barriers and compliance requirements associated with a proposed cloud computing transaction..." So ultimately, you need to know for yourself whether or not you can even enter into an agreement with a cloud service provider. You cannot just assume that you can go ahead and do that. The type of organization you work with may prohibit that. So again, due diligence, do your homework as mentioned, and certainly just get a good understanding of what it is you need and then whether or not the service provider can meet those needs.

### Cloud Storage Governance Issues
[Video description begins] Topic title: Cloud Storage Governance Issues. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson [Video description ends]
Cloud storage governance issues effectively come into play once any given individual or organization has decided to adopt a cloud-based Storage as a Service model, and doing so, of course, adds another layer of complexity to the overall document management within your enterprise. So the appropriate governance of data systems and files, the overall information that are hosted in an enterprise, which utilize both traditional and cloud storage systems, is critically important to that organization now. So the design and the implementation of control and Information Governance, or IG, policy procedure should be tested and in place before the implementation of a Storage as a Service system. Integration with existing local storage mechanism should be pre-established. So you know, again it's something that you want to do your homework on. You want to make sure that everything is suitable, that all of the needs are being met, and that all of the requirements are in place before you implement your control and/or your governance of the data that you're storing and accessing.

Typically, end-user training and awareness programs should provide the platform for successful implementation. It's definitely something that will assist the transition, particularly if it's something that is relatively new to most users. You know, being aware of the fact that the data is not stored locally within their own organization, they need to be aware of that. All key stakeholders should be involved in the design of the policy system, which will drive and support the new document storage and retrieval mechanisms. So it's not just the end users, of course, but everyone concerned, particularly those responsible for making the decisions in any given organization. And do recall that the Cloud Security Alliance provides assistance with this. They've established a Data Governance Working Group and a Data Governance Project. And again, you can see the URLs there. So you can go and research that documentation, and just get a better picture of what needs to be in place to support an effective and manageable cloud storage solution.

[Video description begins] The Data Governance Working Group can be found at the following link: https://blog.cloudsecurityallliance.org/2015/06/04/ csa-establishes-cloud-data-governance- working-group-and-releases-governance-framework/. And the Data Governance Project can be found at the following link: https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/cdg/#_overview. [Video description ends]

### Cloud Storage and Privacy Concerns
[Video description begins] Topic title: Cloud Storage and Privacy Concerns. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson. [Video description ends]
Some of the primary concerns with cloud storage and privacy include identity management, which is the process of controlling access to the data and the files based on who you are. What is your identity? So with this, of course, we need an end-user system in place for them to supply their credentials. And then we also need a system in place at the provider. They will also require credentials so that obviously not just anyone can access the data that's stored there. So you might find what's known as a hybrid integration using a Federation Service or what's also typically referred to as SSO, which is Single Sign-On, and this is a process wherein the user will identify themselves to their own organization by logging in, for example, with their username and password and then having the provider accept that authentication. So if you will, there's a trust that's set up between the provider and your organization that says in essence, as long as your users have authenticated to your systems, then we will accept that. This way they don't have to maintain two separate sets of credentials, one for their own internal organization and another one for the provider.

So there are also things like public key and private key management that go along with that in terms of certificate services if you are implementing that. But you know, all of this is meant to keep the data and the files secure so that only the appropriate people are able to gain access. So along with that, the file access is simply controlled so that you know only the appropriate people are gaining access. So there are a lot of steps, if you will, or a lot of pieces of this puzzle, but it does begin with the authentication that you see down below. This is basically what we just covered in terms of the credentials, [Video description begins] Authentication establishes and validates a user's digital identity by requesting a Username and Password to access an LOB app. [Video description ends] but authentication is always simply establishing and validating a user's identity. Once that has been done, then you have to start considering things like the bulleted list we see here. Authorization, which is the degree of file access control at the provider end, what kind of permissions, for example, read/write/modify. And then from that point, who is responsible for management of shared data? Who owns the share? Ultimately, who says I'm responsible?

File isolation, your files have to be isolated and protected from other users in a multitenant hosting environment. You know, most cloud services are shared. It's not just you as the only customer. So you need to make sure that your files are isolated from other users' files. And of course, the security encryption of passive files, those that are there just sitting at rest on the disks as well as encryption of files in transit. Typically, some of the data encryption that is required, things like credit card numbers, social security numbers, you know, things that are typically kept private. And obviously who owns any given file, who is responsible for file A, who is responsible for file B, and so on, and certainly what is the backup and storage policy. So all of this sort of falls under the classification of authorization and management, but ultimately you have to first identify yourself. Then you access any given application. Then it's determined whether or not you have access to a particular data set and if you do, what can you do with it. So all of these things need to be considered.

The physical storage, you certainly need to be aware. What is the physical location of the hosting machines and the drives? And what if any ramifications are there if there are multiple locations in terms of the data repositories? A lot of providers have many different physical locations. That brings into play backup and copy transfers between servers during replication that may be in different physical locations. And of course, what mechanisms are in place to prevent failure and/or deal with theft? So again, a number of concerns and you just have to make sure that these are addressed and that the provider is able to mitigate these concerns to a suitable degree.

### Cloud Storage Data Classification
[Video description begins] Topic title: Cloud Storage Data Classification. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson [Video description ends]
Data classification is a means by which we assign a relative value to some kind of corporate data asset, the data and the files that we use. But for the most part, it's typically something that you see when you are trying to categorize information by sensitivity or business importance. Obviously, some information is more sensitive than others with respect to who should be able to gain access to it. So you have to evaluate the risk levels associated with data that might be intended for cloud storage. Now this is a continuous process, but you certainly should establish this prior to your Storage as a Service deployment. But from that point, it's something that you always need to continually maintain as well. But overall, classification helps to ensure that sensitive or confidential data assets are treated with more care than assets that are considered to be public or less important, and that kind of stands to reason, you know. Some information, promotional information, for example, you want everyone to see it. But by the same token, there's personal information that you actually don't want everyone to see. So that's what we are doing with classification, simply identifying how this particular information should be treated.

Now all stakeholders should be involved in the data classification process so that we don't overlook anything. You want to make sure that everyone concerned is involved. Now another thing to consider is the state of data. This doesn't really have an effect on its classification, but it's just something to be aware of. And there are three states. A passive data state means the file or the data is currently not being used. It's also referred to as at rest. It's simply on the disk, just being stored. In process, a file is being edited or the data is being altered. In transit, files or data are being uploaded, or downloaded, or transferred via any particular means. So in general, a file's classification does not change regardless of the state. For example, a confidential file remains confidential even if its state changes. You know, you might be in process, for example, editing the file, making a few changes, then you just save it and close it. That has no effect on its overall classification.

Now there is another thing to be aware of what's known as the data structure. Certain information is considered to be structured. Well, some is considered to be unstructured. Now structured generally refers to the fact that the data is organized. So databases, XML files, spreadsheets, they have a tabular structure, for example, wherein we see columns, and rows, and our matrices, things that simply describe the information. You could look at, let's say, a customer table, and you could look up their address very easily because it has that structured field, and you can locate it very easily. And unstructured is simply a document, something that you just might sit down and type up, a memo, or something like that, and/or an e-mail. There is no real structure to that. There's nothing to describe the information, so those are also just things to consider. They don't change again the classification, but just things to be aware of. So the classification life cycle typically involves these four different phases wherein we begin with planning, identify the data assets, [Video description begins] The Data Classification Life Cycle's four phases are: plan, do, check, and act. [Video description ends] identify a data custodian, and develop protection profiles for that data; deploy the classification program and implement enforcement technologies; then review the classification and report and/or maintain logs; and when necessary, reclassify the data because usually it will change at some point.

So data classification is very closely associated with authentication because, of course, this determines who you are. So this completely controls who has access to the data file repositories. Then the authorization is the level of control. So once you have been authenticated, it then comes down to, well, what can you do. And then finally, the roles and responsibilities, the ability to manage the degree of a data asset access and, of course, whether or not they can allocate sharing of that data as well. So once you have classified the data, cloud providers should make written commitments to customers about how they will support classification and authorization and how they propose to secure and maintain the privacy of the customer cloud hosted data and file assets. So you want to make sure that your provider is adhering to your classification, your authentication, your authorization means.

Now in terms of, you know, how are you assured of this, well, the Cloud Security Alliance's Cloud Control Matrix question on Data Governance basically outlines this. So you see that there are various sections within this document that determine the level of classification that is going to be implemented. So this again is something that you can download, and you can find out for yourself whether or not your provider is meeting these classification requirements. [Video description begins] The section heading is: The Cloud Security Alliance's Cloud Control Matrix question on Data Governance -Classification (DSI-01). A sample of a document titled CCMv3 Cloud Controls Matrix Version 3.0 displays. There are columns for Control Domain, CCM v33.0 Control ID, Control Specifications, and AJCPA Trust Service Criteria. A text box connected to the Control Specification area reads: "Data and objects containing data shall be assigned a classification based on data type, jurisdiction of origin, jurisdiction domiciled, context, legal constraints, contractual constraints, value, sensitivity, criticality to the organization, third-party obligation for retention, and prevention of unauthorized disclosure or misuse." [Video description ends] And there are also a number of other regulatory commissions and organizations that also define how data storage and management should be undertaken, so several. You see here again the NIST, the AICPA, which is the American Institute of CPAs, Chartered Public Accountants. SOC is Service Organization Control. The CSA Guidance Version 3.0, that's the Cloud Security Alliance that we just spoke of, and the European implementation of that known as ENISA. All of these organizations determine and/or outline the security classifications that should be implemented when it comes to how data needs to be stored and treated, particularly in a cloud environment. So they all have documents that you can download and you can read through those and make sure that the classifications that you have determined are being upheld by your cloud service provider. [Video description begins] The documentation link for the ENISA IAF –6.04.03. (a) –Cloud Computing Information Assurance Framework is as follows: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-information-assurance-framework.

### Cloud Storage and Data Security
[Video description begins] Topic title: Cloud Storage and Data Security. Your host for this session is Aaron Sampson [Video description ends]
Cloud storage and data security is of particular importance to most organizations, and it simply refers to a set of policies, practices, technologies, and controls that have been adopted and are deployed to protect the data, the applications, and the associated infrastructure of the cloud platform. So ultimately, we want to know that our information is secure in the cloud, but it has to be considered from both sides. In other words, it's not all on the provider. We have to evaluate the security at the client side and the provider side. So the provider must ensure that the service infrastructure is secure and that the client data and applications are protected, of course, but the client also has to ensure things like the use of strong passwords, appropriate authentication measures, appropriate file locations, and classifications, access mechanisms, file share integrity. All of this needs to be implemented via various policies because, of course, if a user is, for example, divulging their username and password to anyone out there, well, this is certainly not the fault of the provider. So you need to make sure that both ends are secure.

So some due diligence of the provider's security measures, when considering the implementation of a service, will include things like the data center integrity. Find out the configuration and number of tiers in their system. What kind of file resiliency do they support? What is their disaster recovery? Find out the plan for disaster recovery and business continuity. Is there any kind of incident reporting that's proactively delivered back to the client? Find out any kind of compliance or certifications that they've obtained and, of course, the encryption of the data. What's their approach? What's their mechanism? Is it applied to all states, files at rest and in transit, for example? So simply what is their overall approach to encryption? And isolation because, of course, it is a multitenant environment. [Video description begins] For encryption, find out the provider's approach and encryption types and find out if the files are secure during upload or download, when in situ, and when archived. [Video description ends] How are your files isolated from other customers? What are the access [Video description begins] For isolation, find out the extent to which the data is isolated from other tenants and the integrity of the isolation. [Video description ends] mechanisms that are in place? Find out how they implement the control of access and whether or not an existing system might be able to be integrated with the providers, something such as federation services and Single Sign-On. Is there any auditing? File access monitoring and access auditing are typically something that you would want to see included. And what kind of migration capabilities are there? Find out their options, and how simple are they to use, and what's the available time scale to move assets if you change provider. So you know, a lot of things to consider when it comes to security, but as always it's just a matter of determining whether or not the provider is able to meet your needs.
